## **Series 65: Advanced Practice Questions (Form ADV Focus)**

### **Question 1**
An investment adviser has discretionary authority over client accounts and uses a third-party custodian. The adviser's Form ADV Part 2A currently states, "We do not have custody of client assets." If the adviser begins using a standing letter of authorization (SLOA) to direct the custodian to send client funds to a third-party charity on a recurring monthly basis, what must the adviser do?

A. No action is required because the assets remain at the qualified custodian
B. Amend Form ADV Part 1 to indicate custody and comply with the Custody Rule's surprise examination requirements
C. Amend Form ADV Part 2A to disclose the arrangement but no custody exists if proper SLOA procedures are followed
D. Notify the SEC within 48 hours of implementing the SLOA arrangement

**Correct Answer:** C. Amend Form ADV Part 2A to disclose the arrangement but no custody exists if proper SLOA procedures are followed

**Explanation:** Under the SEC's 2017 guidance, standing letters of authorization (SLOAs) that meet specific conditions do not constitute custody. The adviser must: (1) obtain client authorization specifying the third party and amount/formula, (2) ensure the custodian verifies authorization and sends confirmations to the client, and (3) maintain appropriate records. While this doesn't trigger Custody Rule requirements, the arrangement must be disclosed in Form ADV Part 2A as it represents a material conflict of interest and operational practice.

### **Question 2**
A state-registered investment adviser with $95 million in AUM has clients in three states: 40 clients in its home state (State A), 12 clients in State B, and 3 clients in State C. The firm has no office in States B or C and does not advertise there. All out-of-state clients were obtained through referrals. Under the de minimis exemption, in which states must the firm register?

A. State A only
B. States A and B only
C. States A, B, and C
D. The firm must register with the SEC instead

**Correct Answer:** B. States A and B only

**Explanation:** The de minimis exemption allows up to 5 clients in a state within 12 months without registration if the adviser has no place of business there and doesn't hold out to the public. State B (12 clients) exceeds the 5-client limit, requiring registration. State C (3 clients) qualifies for the exemption. The firm must register in its home state (State A) regardless of client count. At $95 million AUM, the firm is below the $100 million federal threshold, so state registration remains appropriate.

---

### **Question 3**
An investment adviser's Form ADV Part 2A brochure states the firm charges "1% annually on assets under management." The firm actually uses a tiered schedule: 1.25% on the first $500,000, 1% on the next $500,000, and 0.75% above $1 million. A client with $1.5 million is charged according to the tiered schedule. Which statement is CORRECT?

A. The disclosure is adequate because the client was charged appropriately
B. The firm must amend Form ADV immediately to accurately disclose its fee schedule
C. No violation occurred since the client paid less than the advertised rate
D. The firm only needs to disclose its actual fees in client agreements, not Form ADV

**Correct Answer:** B. The firm must amend Form ADV immediately to accurately disclose its fee schedule

**Explanation:** Form ADV Part 2A must accurately and completely describe the adviser's fee structure. Stating "1% annually" when using a tiered schedule is materially misleading. The adviser must promptly amend Form ADV to disclose the actual tiered fee structure and provide updated brochures to clients. This violates both disclosure requirements and anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act.

---

### **Question 4**
An investment adviser representative (IAR) leaves Firm A and joins Firm B. The IAR has a misdemeanor conviction from 8 years ago for driving under the influence. When must this be disclosed on Form ADV?

A. Immediately by Firm B in its next amendment
B. Only if the conviction is investment-related
C. Within 30 days of the IAR joining Firm B
D. It need not be disclosed as it's over 5 years old

**Correct Answer:** A. Immediately by Firm B in its next amendment

**Explanation:** Investment-related misdemeanors and any felony convictions within the past 10 years must be disclosed on Form ADV. DUI convictions are generally reportable regardless of investment relation if they involve false statements or fraud. Firm B must file an amendment to Form ADV Part 1B (DRP) within 30 days of learning of the reportable event.

---

### **Question 5**
A federally registered investment adviser with $150 million in AUM discovers that its Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) failed to file annual updating amendments for the past two years. Several material changes occurred during this period but were not reported. The firm's first corrective action should be to:

A. File all required amendments immediately and disclose the compliance failure in Form ADV
B. Wait for the SEC to examine the firm before taking any action
C. File a single comprehensive amendment covering the most recent changes only
D. Terminate the CCO and hire new compliance personnel before filing amendments

**Correct Answer:** A. File all required amendments immediately and disclose the compliance failure in Form ADV

**Explanation:** The firm must promptly correct all deficiencies by filing required amendments for all material changes that occurred. The compliance failure itself may be a material disclosure item requiring reporting in Form ADV Part 2A. Immediate correction demonstrates good faith and may mitigate regulatory consequences. Waiting for SEC examination or selectively reporting changes would compound the violations.

---

### **Question 6**
An investment adviser's Form ADV Part 1 indicates the firm has $105 million in regulatory AUM. The firm is currently state-registered. Based solely on this AUM amount, the adviser:

A. Must transition to SEC registration within 90 days
B. May choose to remain state-registered or register with the SEC
C. Must register with both state and SEC authorities
D. Is prohibited from SEC registration until reaching $110 million

**Correct Answer:** B. May choose to remain state-registered or register with the SEC

**Explanation:** The $100-$110 million range is the "buffer zone" where advisers may choose either state or SEC registration. At $105 million, the adviser has discretion. If AUM reaches $110 million, SEC registration becomes mandatory (unless an exception applies).

---

### **Question 7**
An investment adviser provides financial planning services and charges hourly fees. The firm's Form ADV Part 2A should include all of the following EXCEPT:

A. The specific hourly rate or range of rates
B. Minimum engagement fees if applicable
C. Biographical information of each staff member providing planning services
D. Whether fees are negotiable

**Correct Answer:** C. Biographical information of each staff member providing planning services

**Explanation:** While Form ADV Part 2B requires biographical information for supervised persons providing investment advice, Part 2A focuses on the firm's services, fees, and conflicts. Specific staff biographies are not required in Part 2A unless they relate to disciplinary history or material conflicts.

---

### **Question 8**
A state-registered investment adviser with $75 million in AUM begins using a new portfolio management software provided by its custodian at no cost, in exchange for directing $5 million in monthly trading to that custodian. This arrangement must be disclosed in:

A. Form ADV Part 1 only
B. Form ADV Part 2A only
C. Both Part 1 and Part 2A
D. Client agreements only

**Correct Answer:** C. Both Part 1 and Part 2A

**Explanation:** Soft dollar arrangements must be disclosed in Form ADV Part 1 (Item 8) and described in detail in Part 2A. The arrangement creates a conflict of interest (the adviser receives a benefit that may influence trading decisions) and must be fully disclosed to clients.

---

### **Question 9**
An investment adviser representative is also a licensed insurance agent and receives commissions for insurance products sold to advisory clients. This information must appear in:

A. Form ADV Part 2A only
B. Form ADV Part 2B only
C. Both Part 2A and Part 2B
D. Neither; it's disclosed through insurance licensing

**Correct Answer:** C. Both Part 2A and Part 2B

**Explanation:** The conflict of interest must be disclosed at both the firm level (Part 2A) and the individual level (Part 2B). Clients need to know the dual registration and compensation arrangement, as it may influence recommendations.

---

### **Question 10**
An investment adviser's assets under management decrease from $105 million to $98 million due to market conditions. The adviser is currently SEC-registered. What registration action is required?

A. Transition to state registration within 30 days
B. Transition to state registration within 180 days
C. File an amendment but may remain SEC-registered
D. No action required; registration status remains unchanged

**Correct Answer:** C. File an amendment but may remain SEC-registered

**Explanation:** Advisers whose AUM falls below $90 million must transition to state registration. At $98 million, the adviser remains above this threshold. However, the AUM change is material and requires an amendment to Form ADV Part 1. The adviser may choose to remain SEC-registered until AUM falls below $90 million.

---

### **Question 11**
An investment adviser changes its legal name from "ABC Advisors" to "XYZ Wealth Management." The firm must file a Form ADV amendment:

A. Within 30 days
B. Within 90 days
C. At the next annual updating amendment
D. Within 5 business days

**Correct Answer:** A. Within 30 days

**Explanation:** Changes to the adviser's legal name, form of organization, or principal office address require "other-than-annual" amendments within 30 days. This is a material change that makes previously filed information inaccurate.

---

### **Question 12**
A client complains that an investment adviser's performance advertisement claims "average annual returns of 15% over 5 years" but doesn't disclose that this figure is before deducting advisory fees. This advertisement violates:

A. Only if the returns are not substantiated
B. The requirement to show net-of-fee returns
C. No violation; gross returns may be shown if identified as such
D. Only if the advertisement doesn't include past performance disclaimers

**Correct Answer:** B. The requirement to show net-of-fee returns

**Explanation:** The SEC's Marketing Rule requires that performance results shown in advertisements must be net of fees, unless gross returns are also presented with equal prominence. Showing only gross returns without disclosing they don't reflect fees is misleading.

---

### **Question 13**
An investment adviser has a wrap fee program where clients pay a single bundled fee for both investment management and brokerage services. This program must be disclosed in:

A. Form ADV Part 1A only
B. Form ADV Part 2A only
C. Both Part 1A and Part 2A
D. Separate SEC Form ADV-W

**Correct Answer:** C. Both Part 1A and Part 2A

**Explanation:** Wrap fee programs require disclosure in both parts of Form ADV. Part 1A requires specific information about wrap programs, and Part 2A must describe the program, fees, conflicts, and other material information for clients.

---

### **Question 14**
An investment adviser's principal place of business moves from New York to New Jersey. The firm has clients in both states. Registration requirements are:

A. Register in New Jersey only
B. Register in both New York and New Jersey
C. Register in New Jersey and notice file in New York
D. Register in New Jersey and withdraw from New York registration

**Correct Answer:** D. Register in New Jersey and withdraw from New York registration

**Explanation:** The adviser must register in New Jersey (new principal place of business) and withdraw from New York registration. However, if the firm still has more than 5 clients in New York, it may need to register there as well unless qualifying for de minimis exemption.

---

### **Question 15**
An investment adviser receives directed brokerage from a mutual fund company in exchange for recommending its funds. This arrangement must be disclosed:

A. Only if the adviser receives cash compensation
B. In Form ADV Part 2A and in a separate disclosure document
C. Only to clients who invest in the mutual funds
D. In the adviser's advertising materials only

**Correct Answer:** B. In Form ADV Part 2A and in a separate disclosure document

**Explanation:** Directed brokerage arrangements create material conflicts and must be disclosed in Form ADV Part 2A. Additionally, specific disclosures may be required at the point of sale, especially if the arrangement involves revenue sharing or other compensation.

---

### **Question 16**
An investment adviser's Form ADV indicates it has custody of client assets because it serves as trustee for several client trusts. To comply with the Custody Rule, the adviser must:

A. Have an independent public accountant conduct surprise examinations
B. Provide quarterly account statements directly to clients
C. Maintain a surety bond of at least $500,000
D. File Form ADV-C within 48 hours of discovering custody

**Correct Answer:** A. Have an independent public accountant conduct surprise examinations

**Explanation:** When an adviser has custody (as trustee), it generally must undergo annual surprise examinations by an independent public accountant. There are exceptions if the trust is subject to annual audit, but for most family trusts, surprise exams are required.

---

### **Question 17**
An investment adviser representative has a bankruptcy discharge that is 7 years old. This must be disclosed in Form ADV if:

A. The bankruptcy involved more than $50,000
B. The bankruptcy was business-related
C. It occurred within the past 10 years
D. It was a Chapter 7 bankruptcy

**Correct Answer:** C. It occurred within the past 10 years

**Explanation:** Bankruptcy events within the past 10 years must be disclosed on Form ADV, regardless of amount or type. Only personal (not business) bankruptcies are reportable, and they must be disclosed if within the 10-year window.

---

### **Question 18**
A state-registered investment adviser with $85 million in AUM begins offering a new service: preparing tax returns for clients. This change requires:

A. No Form ADV amendment; it's a separate service
B. Amendment to Form ADV Part 1 only
C. Amendment to Form ADV Part 2A only
D. Amendments to both Part 1 and Part 2A

**Correct Answer:** C. Amendment to Form ADV Part 2A only

**Explanation:** Adding a new service is a material change that requires amendment to Form ADV Part 2A to describe the service, fees, and any conflicts. Part 1 typically doesn't require amendment for new service offerings unless they fundamentally change the nature of the advisory business.

---

### **Question 19**
An investment adviser's marketing materials state: "Our firm has never been subject to regulatory disciplinary action." In fact, the firm settled an SEC administrative proceeding 8 years ago. This statement violates:

A. Only if clients were harmed by the earlier proceeding
B. The prohibition against false or misleading statements
C. No violation; proceedings over 5 years old need not be disclosed
D. Only if the statement appears in Form ADV

**Correct Answer:** B. The prohibition against false or misleading statements

**Explanation:** This is a false statement that violates anti-fraud provisions. Disciplinary history within the past 10 years must be disclosed in Form ADV, and marketing materials cannot make false claims about clean disciplinary records.

---

### **Question 20**
An investment adviser with $300 million in AUM uses a solicitors to refer clients. The solicitor receives 25% of first-year fees. To comply with the cash solicitation rule, the adviser must:

A. Pay the solicitor only after the client has been with the firm 90 days
B. Ensure the solicitor provides each client with a disclosure document
C. Register the solicitor as an investment adviser representative
D. All of the above

**Correct Answer:** B. Ensure the solicitor provides each client with a disclosure document

**Explanation:** Rule 206(4)-3 requires: (1) written agreement with solicitor, (2) solicitor provides clients with disclosure document, and (3) adviser receives client acknowledgment. Payment timing isn't specified, and solicitors generally don't need to be registered as IARs unless they provide investment advice.

---

### **Question 21**
An investment adviser's Form ADV Part 2A fails to disclose that the firm's principals have outside business activities where they serve as directors of publicly traded companies. This omission is:

A. Permissible if the activities don't conflict with advisory services
B. A material omission requiring prompt amendment
C. Only problematic if clients invest in those companies
D. Disclosed through other regulatory filings, not Form ADV

**Correct Answer:** B. A material omission requiring prompt amendment

**Explanation:** Outside business activities that present conflicts must be disclosed in Form ADV Part 2A. Serving as a corporate director creates potential conflicts (insider information, loyalty conflicts) that clients must know about.

---

### **Question 22**
An investment adviser calculates its regulatory AUM to include:

A. Only discretionary assets
B. Discretionary and non-discretionary assets under continuous supervision
C. All assets for which advice is provided, regardless of frequency
D. Only assets held at the adviser's chosen custodian

**Correct Answer:** B. Discretionary and non-discretionary assets under continuous supervision

**Explanation:** Regulatory AUM includes assets for which the adviser provides continuous and regular supervisory or management services, whether discretionary or non-discretionary. Assets receiving only sporadic advice are generally excluded.

---

### **Question 23**
An investment adviser changes its fee billing method from quarterly in advance to monthly in arrears. This change requires:

A. Amendment to Form ADV Part 2A and client consent
B. Amendment to Form ADV Part 1 only
C. No amendment; it's an operational change
D. SEC approval before implementation

**Correct Answer:** A. Amendment to Form ADV Part 2A and client consent

**Explanation:** Changes to fee billing methods are material changes requiring Form ADV Part 2A amendment and client consent (since it modifies the advisory agreement). Clients must receive updated brochures before the change takes effect.

---

### **Question 24**
A state-registered investment adviser with $45 million in AUM merges with another adviser, creating a combined firm with $110 million in AUM. The new firm must:

A. Remain state-registered for one year
B. Register with the SEC within 90 days
C. Choose either state or SEC registration
D. Register with both state and SEC authorities

**Correct Answer:** B. Register with the SEC within 90 days

**Explanation:** When AUM exceeds $110 million, SEC registration is required (subject to certain exceptions). The firm has 90 days from exceeding the threshold to register with the SEC and withdraw from state registration.

---

### **Question 25**
An investment adviser's brochure supplement (Part 2B) must be delivered to clients:

A. At least 48 hours before entering advisory contract
B. At time of entering advisory contract or shortly after
C. Within 30 days of contract execution
D. Annually with Form ADV updates

**Correct Answer:** B. At time of entering advisory contract or shortly after

**Explanation:** The brochure supplement must be delivered at or before the time the client enters into an advisory contract with the supervised person. In practice, many advisers deliver it with the Part 2A brochure.

---

### **Question 26**
An investment adviser includes hypothetical performance in its marketing materials. Under the Marketing Rule, the adviser must:

A. Obtain prior written consent from the SEC
B. Maintain records supporting all hypothetical assumptions
C. Ensure the performance is net of all fees and expenses
D. Both B and C

**Correct Answer:** D. Both B and C

**Explanation:** For hypothetical performance, the Marketing Rule requires: (1) adopting policies to ensure performance is relevant to likely financial situation/investment objectives, (2) providing information on assumptions, (3) disclosing limitations, and (4) maintaining records. Net performance presentation is generally required for all performance advertising.

---

### **Question 27**
An investment adviser has a website that states: "Our investment strategies have consistently outperformed the market." This statement is:

A. Permissible if accompanied by past performance data
B. Permissible if accompanied by "past performance" disclaimer
C. Prohibited as an unsubstantiated claim
D. Permissible for institutional clients only

**Correct Answer:** C. Prohibited as an unsubstantiated claim

**Explanation:** Unsubstantiated claims of outperformance are prohibited as misleading. Even with disclaimers, such absolute claims violate anti-fraud rules unless they can be substantiated with specific, accurate performance data presented in compliance with Marketing Rule requirements.

---

### **Question 28**
An investment adviser's compliance officer discovers that the firm has been calculating regulatory AUM incorrectly by excluding non-discretionary managed accounts. The corrected AUM is $115 million, while the firm reported $95 million. The firm is state-registered. The first corrective step is to:

A. File an amendment to correct AUM and transition to SEC registration
B. Reduce AUM to stay below $100 million threshold
C. File an amendment but remain state-registered
D. Notify clients but take no regulatory action

**Correct Answer:** A. File an amendment to correct AUM and transition to SEC registration

**Explanation:** At $115 million AUM, the firm exceeds the $110 million mandatory SEC registration threshold. The firm must file an amendment to correct the AUM and begin the process of registering with the SEC and withdrawing from state registration.

---

### **Question 29**
An investment adviser's Form ADV indicates it participates in wrap fee programs. In its brochure, the adviser must disclose:

A. Only the total wrap fee percentage
B. The wrap fee and underlying expenses
C. That wrap fees may be higher than separate fees
D. Both B and C

**Correct Answer:** D. Both B and C

**Explanation:** For wrap fee programs, Form ADV Part 2A must disclose both the wrap fee itself and the fact that underlying investments have their own expenses. The brochure should also disclose that clients might pay more in a wrap program than if they paid separately for advice and execution.

---

### **Question 30**
An investment adviser representative receives gifts from a broker-dealer totaling $350 in a year. This must be disclosed:

A. In Form ADV Part 1
B. In Form ADV Part 2A
C. In both Part 1 and Part 2A
D. Only if gifts exceed $100 per instance

**Correct Answer:** C. In both Part 1 and Part 2A

**Explanation:** Gifts or gratuities from third parties that relate to advisory services create conflicts and must be disclosed. Form ADV Part 1 asks about receipt of non-cash compensation. Part 2A should disclose the conflict generally, though specific dollar amounts may not be required.

---

### **Question 31**
An investment adviser's annual updating amendment to Form ADV must be filed within:

A. 30 days of fiscal year end
B. 60 days of fiscal year end
C. 90 days of fiscal year end
D. 120 days of fiscal year end

**Correct Answer:** C. 90 days of fiscal year end

**Explanation:** Form ADV annual updating amendments are due within 90 days of the adviser's fiscal year end. This updates all information and renews the registration.

---

### **Question 32**
An investment adviser uses social media to communicate with clients. A representative posts: "Just recommended ABC stock to all my clients - expect big gains!" This communication:

A. Violates restrictions on specific investment recommendations
B. Is permissible if only clients see the post
C. Is permissible with past performance disclaimer
D. Violates confidentiality but not advertising rules

**Correct Answer:** A. Violates restrictions on specific investment recommendations

**Explanation:** Specific investment recommendations on social media may violate advertising rules if they: (1) aren't fair and balanced, (2) make unsubstantiated claims, (3) don't consider appropriateness for all recipients, or (4) violate recordkeeping requirements. Such posts also raise suitability and fiduciary duty concerns.

---

### **Question 33**
An investment adviser has custody because it serves as trustee. The adviser must ensure clients receive account statements:

A. Directly from the adviser quarterly
B. Directly from the custodian quarterly
C. Directly from the custodian monthly
D. From either the adviser or custodian quarterly

**Correct Answer:** B. Directly from the custodian quarterly

**Explanation:** When an adviser has custody, qualified custodians must send account statements directly to clients at least quarterly. This independent verification helps protect client assets.

---

### **Question 34**
An investment adviser's brochure states it "may invest client assets in mutual funds." The firm actually invests almost exclusively in proprietary mutual funds. This disclosure is:

A. Adequate; proprietary funds are mutual funds
B. Inadequate; it omits material conflict information
C. Adequate if disclosed in client agreements
D. Inadequate only for non-accredited investors

**Correct Answer:** B. Inadequate; it omits material conflict information

**Explanation:** Investing in proprietary funds creates significant conflicts (the adviser earns management fees from the funds). This must be specifically disclosed in Form ADV Part 2A, including how the conflict is addressed.

---

### **Question 35**
An investment adviser's chief compliance officer leaves the firm. This change requires a Form ADV amendment:

A. Within 30 days
B. Within 90 days
C. At next annual update
D. No amendment required

**Correct Answer:** A. Within 30 days

**Explanation:** Changes in executive officers, including the CCO, are material changes requiring "other-than-annual" amendments within 30 days. The CCO is typically listed in Form ADV Schedule A.

---

### **Question 36**
An investment adviser's Form ADV Part 1 indicates the firm has 6 non-clerical employees. The firm hires 2 new investment adviser representatives. The amendment to update this information must be filed:

A. Within 30 days
B. Within 90 days
C. At next annual update
D. Within 5 business days

**Correct Answer:** A. Within 30 days

**Explanation:** Changes in the number of employees, particularly IARs, are material changes requiring prompt amendment. The firm must also file Form U4 for each new IAR and update Schedule A of Form ADV.

---

### **Question 37**
An investment adviser receives research from a broker-dealer in exchange for directing client trades. Under Section 28(e), this soft dollar arrangement:

A. Must provide research that assists in investment decisions
B. May include general office equipment
C. Must be disclosed only if research exceeds 5% of commissions
D. Is prohibited for ERISA accounts

**Correct Answer:** A. Must provide research that assists in investment decisions

**Explanation:** Section 28(e) safe harbor permits paying more than lowest commission only for "brokerage and research services" that provide lawful and appropriate assistance. General office equipment or non-research services don't qualify.

---

### **Question 38**
An investment adviser's performance advertisement shows 1, 5, and 10-year returns. Under the Marketing Rule, the advertisement must also show:

A. The performance of a relevant benchmark
B. Each individual client's actual returns
C. The worst-performing account returns
D. Performance gross of all fees and expenses

**Correct Answer:** A. The performance of a relevant benchmark

**Explanation:** The Marketing Rule requires that performance presentations include or offer to provide performance of an appropriate benchmark, unless the advertisement doesn't show performance over time periods. Benchmarks must be comparable to the advertised strategy.

---

### **Question 39**
An investment adviser's brochure supplement for an IAR must include:

A. The IAR's specific compensation arrangement
B. Details of the IAR's educational background
C. The IAR's exact assets under management
D. All business activities outside the firm

**Correct Answer:** B. Details of the IAR's educational background

**Explanation:** Form ADV Part 2B requires: educational background and business experience, disciplinary history, other business activities, additional compensation, and supervision. Specific compensation details and exact AUM are not required.

---

### **Question 40**
An investment adviser with $500 million in AUM changes its state of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada. This requires:

A. Amendment to Form ADV Part 1 within 30 days
B. New registration with the SEC
C. Consent from all existing clients
D. Both A and B

**Correct Answer:** A. Amendment to Form ADV Part 1 within 30 days

**Explanation:** Changes in legal organization or state of incorporation require Form ADV amendments within 30 days. Since the firm remains SEC-registered (well above thresholds), no new SEC registration is needed, though state notice filings may be required.

---

### **Question 41**
An investment adviser's marketing materials include testimonials from three clients. Under the Marketing Rule, the adviser must:

A. Disclose whether testimonial providers were compensated
B. Obtain prior SEC approval for the testimonials
C. Ensure testimonials represent average client experience
D. All of the above

**Correct Answer:** A. Disclose whether testimonial providers were compensated

**Explanation:** The Marketing Rule permits testimonials if specific disclosures are made, including whether providers received compensation and any material conflicts. SEC approval is not required, and testimonials need not represent average experience but must not be misleading.

---

### **Question 42**
An investment adviser discovers an error in its Form ADV Part 2A regarding the description of investment strategies. The brochure stated "we do not use options" when in fact some client accounts use options for hedging. The firm must:

A. Correct the error in the next annual amendment
B. Amend immediately and provide corrected brochures to clients
C. Notify clients but wait for annual update to amend
D. Only correct for new clients going forward

**Correct Answer:** B. Amend immediately and provide corrected brochures to clients

**Explanation:** Material inaccuracies in Part 2A require prompt correction. The firm must amend Form ADV and deliver updated brochures to existing clients. This is not a matter that can wait for the annual update.

---

### **Question 43**
An investment adviser's Form ADV Part 1 indicates the firm has 120 clients. The adviser determines that 15 of these are family members who receive services at no cost. For Form ADV purposes, these family members:

A. Must be counted as clients
B. Should not be counted as clients
C. Count as half a client each
D. Count only if they have over $50,000 in assets

**Correct Answer:** B. Should not be counted as clients

**Explanation:** Family members who receive advisory services without compensation and as an accommodation generally should not be counted as clients for Form ADV purposes. The test is whether there is a bona fide advisory relationship with compensation.

---

### **Question 44**
An investment adviser uses model portfolios that are occasionally adjusted. The firm must disclose in Form ADV Part 2A:

A. Each specific security in the models
B. How often models are reviewed and rebalanced
C. Past performance of each model portfolio
D. The exact number of clients in each model

**Correct Answer:** B. How often models are reviewed and rebalanced

**Explanation:** Form ADV Part 2A should describe investment strategies, including use of models, frequency of review, and rebalancing approach. Specific securities, past performance, and client counts are not required in the brochure.

---

### **Question 45**
An investment adviser has a Code of Ethics that requires reporting of personal securities transactions. Under the Code, access persons must report transactions:

A. Within 30 days of trade date
B. Within 10 days of trade date
C. Within 5 days of trade date
D. Within 48 hours of trade date

**Correct Answer:** B. Within 10 days of trade date

**Explanation:** Rule 204A-1 requires access persons to report personal securities transactions at least quarterly, with transactions reported no later than 30 days after quarter end. Many firms require more frequent reporting, but the rule minimum is quarterly with 30-day reporting.

---

### **Question 46**
An investment adviser's Form ADV indicates it has $80 million in regulatory AUM. The firm has a separate $25 million hedge fund it advises. For Form ADV purposes, the hedge fund:

A. Counts as one client
B. Counts each investor as a client
C. Is excluded from AUM calculations
D. Is excluded from client count but included in AUM

**Correct Answer:** A. Counts as one client

**Explanation:** Private funds are generally counted as one client for Form ADV purposes (the fund itself), but the fund's assets are included in regulatory AUM. This prevents double-counting of investors while accurately reflecting assets managed.

---

### **Question 47**
An investment adviser changes its custody arrangement from having a related person as custodian to using an independent third-party custodian. This change requires:

A. Amendment to Form ADV within 30 days
B. Client consent for each account
C. SEC approval of the new custodian
D. Both A and B

**Correct Answer:** A. Amendment to Form ADV within 30 days

**Explanation:** Changes in custody arrangements are material changes requiring Form ADV amendment within 30 days. Client consent may be required if the advisory agreement specifies the custodian, but regulatory approval of the custodian is not generally required.

---

### **Question 48**
An investment adviser's brochure states: "We monitor client portfolios daily." In reality, portfolios are reviewed monthly. This statement is:

A. Permissible as marketing language
B. Misleading and requires correction
C. Permissible if some accounts are reviewed daily
D. Only problematic if clients complain

**Correct Answer:** B. Misleading and requires correction

**Explanation:** Form ADV disclosures must accurately reflect actual practices. Claiming daily monitoring when reviews are monthly is materially misleading and violates disclosure requirements and anti-fraud provisions.

---

### **Question 49**
An investment adviser representative is convicted of a felony for tax evasion. The firm must update Form ADV:

A. Within 30 days
B. Within 90 days
C. At next annual update
D. Within 5 business days

**Correct Answer:** A. Within 30 days

**Explanation:** Felony convictions are reportable events requiring "other-than-annual" amendments to Form ADV within 30 days of the firm becoming aware of the event. This includes both investment-related and non-investment-related felonies.

### **Question 50**
An investment adviser with $200 million in AUM merges with another adviser. Post-merger, the combined firm must file:

A. An amendment to existing Form ADV
B. A new Form ADV registration
C. Form ADV-W for the disappearing firm
D. Both B and C

**Correct Answer:** D. Both B and C

**Explanation:** In a merger, the surviving firm typically files an amendment to its Form ADV, while the disappearing firm files Form ADV-W (withdrawal). However, if the merger creates what is effectively a new entity, a new registration may be required. The specific approach depends on the merger structure and regulatory guidance.

# Practice Questions: Series 65 Exam - Advanced Level (Form ADV Focus)

## Question 1
Bright Future Advisers, LLC is a state-registered investment adviser with $85 million in assets under management. The firm currently has 12 investment adviser representatives and provides portfolio management services to approximately 180 clients, including individuals, small businesses, and trusts. The firm's Chief Compliance Officer, Jennifer, is conducting the annual review of the firm's Form ADV and discovers several issues: (1) The firm began offering financial planning services 8 months ago but never updated Part 2A to reflect this new service; (2) Two IARs left the firm 5 months ago, but the firm never filed amendments to remove them from Form ADV Part 1; (3) The firm's assets under management have grown to $92 million, crossing potential federal registration thresholds, but this hasn't been updated; (4) The principal office address changed 3 months ago when the firm relocated, but Form ADV still lists the old address; and (5) A disciplinary action against one of the firm's IARs was resolved 4 months ago, but this disclosure was never added. How should Jennifer address these Form ADV compliance issues, and what are the potential regulatory consequences?

A. Jennifer should immediately file Form ADV amendments for all material changes, recognizing that the firm has violated the requirement to file "other-than-annual" amendments within 30 days of material changes, and the firm may face regulatory sanctions for these failures
B. Jennifer can wait until the next annual updating amendment is due since all changes occurred within the same fiscal year and no clients have specifically requested updated disclosure documents
C. Jennifer only needs to file amendments for items (2) and (4) since changes in personnel and address are the only items requiring prompt amendment; service offerings and AUM can be updated annually
D. Jennifer should file a complete new Form ADV registration rather than amendments, since multiple sections require updates and this is the most efficient approach

**Correct Answer:** A. Jennifer should immediately file Form ADV amendments for all material changes, recognizing that the firm has violated the requirement to file "other-than-annual" amendments within 30 days of material changes, and the firm may face regulatory sanctions for these failures

**Explanation:** Investment advisers must file "other-than-annual amendments" to Form ADV within 30 days whenever information in Form ADV Part 1 becomes inaccurate in any way, and must update Part 2 (the brochure) promptly when information becomes materially inaccurate. Bright Future Advisers has violated these requirements in multiple ways: (1) Adding financial planning services is a material change requiring prompt amendment to Part 2A; (2) Changes in IARs must be reflected in Form ADV Part 1 within 30 days; (3) AUM growth that potentially triggers federal registration requirements is material and requires prompt updating; (4) Principal office address changes must be updated within 30 days; (5) Disciplinary events must be disclosed promptly. The firm has been operating with an inaccurate Form ADV for months, which is a serious compliance violation. Option B is incorrect because material changes cannot wait for the annual update - they require prompt "other-than-annual amendments" within 30 days. Option C is incorrect because all five items listed are material changes requiring prompt amendment, not just personnel and address changes. Option D is incorrect because amendments are the proper mechanism for updates; filing an entirely new registration is unnecessary and inappropriate for routine updates.

## Question 2
Greenfield Investment Management is a federally registered investment adviser with $450 million in assets under management. The firm primarily serves high-net-worth individuals and maintains full discretionary authority over most client accounts. During the annual Form ADV update process, the compliance team is reviewing whether certain arrangements and practices must be disclosed in Part 2A (the firm brochure). The following situations have arisen in the past year: (1) The firm has a soft dollar arrangement with its primary broker-dealer where the firm receives research reports and portfolio analysis software in exchange for directing client trades to that broker, potentially resulting in higher commission costs for clients; (2) The firm's founding partner owns 15% equity interest in a private hedge fund, and the firm occasionally recommends this hedge fund to qualified clients when appropriate for their objectives; (3) The firm uses a third-party portfolio accounting system provided by a vendor that also provides custodial services, and the firm receives a 20% discount on the accounting software when clients use that vendor as custodian; (4) One of the firm's senior advisers is also a licensed insurance agent and occasionally recommends insurance products to clients, earning commissions on those sales; (5) The firm has an informal referral arrangement with three local CPA firms where they refer clients to each other, though no cash compensation is exchanged. Which of these arrangements MUST be disclosed in Form ADV Part 2A under current SEC requirements?

A. Only items (1), (2), and (4) require disclosure because they involve direct financial compensation or conflicts of interest
B. Items (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) all require disclosure because each represents a conflict of interest or arrangement that could influence the adviser's recommendations
C. Only items (1) and (2) require disclosure because soft dollars and affiliated investments are the primary regulatory concerns; the other items are immaterial business practices
D. Only items (1), (2), and (5) require disclosure; item (3) is a normal business arrangement and item (4) is covered by the insurance agent's separate licensing disclosure

**Correct Answer:** B. Items (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) all require disclosure because each represents a conflict of interest or arrangement that could influence the adviser's recommendations

**Explanation:** Form ADV Part 2A requires comprehensive disclosure of all conflicts of interest and arrangements that could influence the adviser's advice or create incentives that may not align with client interests. Each of these situations must be disclosed: (1) Soft dollar arrangements MUST be disclosed in detail, including what benefits the firm receives and how this might affect commission costs - this is a significant conflict because the firm benefits from directing trades to a particular broker potentially at higher cost to clients; (2) Any financial interest in a recommended investment (even 15% of a hedge fund) is a material conflict that must be disclosed - clients need to know the adviser has a financial stake in recommended investments; (3) The 20% discount on software creates an incentive to recommend a particular custodian, which is a conflict of interest requiring disclosure even though it may seem like a normal business arrangement; (4) Dual registration as an insurance agent and receipt of insurance commissions is a classic conflict that MUST be disclosed - clients need to know the adviser receives additional compensation for insurance recommendations; (5) Referral arrangements, even informal ones without cash compensation, must be disclosed because they create reciprocal incentives that could influence advice.

## Question 3
Horizon Wealth Advisers is a state-registered investment adviser that has experienced significant growth. Three years ago, the firm had $28 million in AUM and 45 clients. Today, the firm has $118 million in AUM and 156 clients spread across multiple states. The firm's principals, David and Sarah, are meeting with their compliance consultant to discuss their registration obligations. The compliance consultant informs them of the following: (1) They may now be required to register with the SEC as a federal covered adviser because they've exceeded $110 million in AUM; (2) They are currently registered only in their home state (State A) but have clients in five other states (States B, C, D, E, and F); (3) In State B, they have 8 clients; in State C, they have 12 clients; in State D, they have 4 clients; in State E, they have 2 clients; and in State F, they have 6 clients; (4) None of these clients were solicited through advertising or general solicitation - all came through referrals or personal networks; (5) The firm maintains no offices outside of State A. Given these facts and applying the de minimis exemption and federal/state registration rules, what are Horizon's registration obligations?

A. Horizon must register with the SEC and terminate all state registrations because they exceed $110 million AUM and federal registration preempts state registration requirements
B. Horizon must register with the SEC (due to exceeding $110 million AUM), must maintain registration in State A (where they have their principal office), and must register in States B, C, and F (where they have more than 5 clients), but can rely on the de minimis exemption in States D and E
C. Horizon should remain state-registered in State A only until they reach $120 million AUM (the mandatory federal registration threshold) and need not register in States B-F because they have no offices in those states and all clients came through referrals
D. Horizon must register with the SEC, must register in all six states where they have clients (A, B, C, D, E, F) because the de minimis exemption does not apply once a firm becomes federally registered, and must file Form ADV with both the SEC and each state

**Correct Answer:** B. Horizon must register with the SEC (due to exceeding $110 million AUM), must maintain registration in State A (where they have their principal office), and must register in States B, C, and F (where they have more than 5 clients), but can rely on the de minimis exemption in States D and E

**Explanation:** This question tests understanding of the federal/state registration thresholds and the de minimis exemption. Investment advisers with AUM of $110 million to $120 million MAY register with the SEC (permissive range), while those with $120 million or more MUST register. At $118 million, Horizon is in the permissive range and should register with the SEC. Even federal covered advisers must maintain notice filings in states where they have their principal place of business. The de minimis exemption allows advisers to have up to 5 clients in a state during a 12-month period without registering, provided: (a) the adviser has no office in that state, and (b) the adviser does not hold itself out to the public as an investment adviser. State B (8 clients), State C (12 clients), and State F (6 clients) exceed the 5-client threshold, requiring notice filing. States D (4 clients) and E (2 clients) qualify for de minimis exemption.

## Question 4
Summit Advisory Group is a federally registered investment adviser that specializes in serving corporate executives and high-net-worth individuals. The firm's Form ADV Part 2A (brochure) is due for its annual updating amendment. The firm's Chief Compliance Officer, Michael, is reviewing the brochure to ensure all required disclosures are accurate and complete. He discovers the following issues: (1) The fee schedule section shows the firm charges "1.00% annually on assets under management," but in practice, the firm has been charging 1.00% on the first $1 million, 0.85% on assets between $1-3 million, and 0.75% on assets above $3 million - this tiered structure is not mentioned in the brochure; (2) The brochure states the firm has $420 million in AUM, but current AUM is actually $510 million; (3) The brochure lists five investment strategies the firm employs, but over the past year, the firm has introduced three additional strategies involving options and derivatives that are not mentioned; (4) The disciplinary history section states "no disciplinary events to report," but six months ago, one of the firm's IARs was censured by FINRA for activities at their previous employer (before joining Summit), and this was not disclosed; (5) The conflicts of interest section does not mention that the firm's founder serves on the board of directors of a publicly traded company and sometimes recommends that stock to clients. Which of these items represent material inaccuracies that must be corrected in Form ADV Part 2A?

A. Items (1), (3), and (5) only, because these directly affect client understanding of fees, investment strategies, and conflicts; items (2) and (4) are technical inaccuracies that can be corrected at the next annual update
B. Items (1), (2), (3), and (5) must be corrected immediately; item (4) does not require disclosure because the disciplinary event occurred before the IAR joined the firm
C. All five items (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) represent material inaccuracies that must be corrected, though the significance and urgency vary
D. Items (1), (3), (4), and (5) must be corrected; item (2) regarding AUM is not material unless the change affects the firm's registration status

**Correct Answer:** C. All five items (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) represent material inaccuracies that must be corrected, though the significance and urgency vary

**Explanation:** Form ADV Part 2A must provide accurate, current, and complete disclosure. Each item is material: (1) Fee schedule discrepancy is highly material - clients must know exact fee structure. Must be corrected immediately with updated brochures. (2) AUM discrepancy ($420M vs. $510M) represents 21% increase and is material. Must be corrected in annual amendment. (3) Failure to disclose new strategies involving options and derivatives is highly material. Clients must know about strategies employed, especially complex instruments. Requires immediate correction. (4) Disciplinary history requirements extend to covered persons' events within past 10 years, even if before joining. FINRA censure must be disclosed if within timeframes and meets materiality thresholds. (5) Board membership and stock recommendations represent clear conflict requiring disclosure. Material omission requiring immediate correction.

## Question 5
Lakeside Investment Advisers is a state-registered investment adviser firm with $75 million in assets under management. The firm is owned by three principals: Jennifer (60% ownership), Marcus (25% ownership), and Lisa (15% ownership). Jennifer serves as Chief Compliance Officer in addition to managing client portfolios. The following events have occurred over the past year: (1) Marcus sold his 25% ownership stake to Jennifer, so Jennifer now owns 85% and Lisa owns 15%; (2) The firm hired two new investment adviser representatives who will have client contact and discretionary authority; (3) Jennifer's personal securities account (held at a brokerage firm unaffiliated with Lakeside) was charged with a trading violation by FINRA for pattern day trading rule violations, resulting in a 90-day trading restriction; (4) The firm's assets under management declined from $75 million to $68 million due to market performance and client withdrawals; (5) Lakeside entered into an agreement with a local CPA firm where the CPA firm will receive a flat $500 referral fee for each client they refer to Lakeside who opens an account with at least $250,000 in assets; (6) The firm began offering hourly financial planning consultations as a new service line, charging $300 per hour with no minimum commitment. Jennifer is preparing the annual updating amendment to Form ADV. Which of these events require disclosure or amendment in Form ADV, and what are the specific disclosure obligations?

A. Items (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) all require Form ADV amendments or disclosures; item (4) requires updating the AUM figure but does not trigger any special registration consequences
B. Items (1), (2), (5), and (6) require amendments; items (3) and (4) do not require disclosure because the FINRA violation was personal to Jennifer and AUM changes below registration thresholds are not material
C. All six items require some form of Form ADV update or disclosure, including ownership changes, personnel additions, disciplinary events, AUM updates, solicitor arrangements, and new service offerings
D. Items (1), (3), and (5) are the only material items requiring immediate "other-than-annual" amendments; the other items can be addressed in the annual updating amendment

**Correct Answer:** C. All six items require some form of Form ADV update or disclosure, including ownership changes, personnel additions, disciplinary events, AUM updates, solicitor arrangements, and new service offerings

**Explanation:** All six events require Form ADV updates: (1) Ownership change from 60% to 85% requires "other-than-annual amendment" within 30 days in Part 1A. (2) New IARs require updating Part 1A Schedule A and Part 2B within 30 days. (3) FINRA trading violation must be disclosed in Part 1A DRP and Part 2A within 30 days - even though personal, Jennifer is principal/CCO. (4) AUM decline must be reflected in Part 1A for accuracy, typically in annual amendment. (5) CPA solicitor arrangement requires Part 2A disclosure and compliance with Rule 206(4)-3. (6) New hourly planning service requires Part 2A update for service and fee structure. Items requiring immediate "other-than-annual amendments": ownership, new IARs, disciplinary events; others should be reflected promptly and in annual update.

## Question 6
Pacific Coast Advisers is a federally registered investment adviser with $280 million in AUM serving approximately 220 clients. The firm's Form ADV Part 2A contains the following statement in the "Fees and Compensation" section: "Our standard advisory fee is 1.25% annually on assets under management, billed quarterly in advance. Fees are negotiable, and we may charge more or less than our standard fee depending on the size of the account, complexity of the client's situation, and the services required." Three clients file complaints with the SEC alleging that: (1) Client A, with $5 million in assets, was charged 1.40% annually while being told this was the "standard fee" with no mention that it was negotiable or higher than usual; (2) Client B, with $800,000 in assets, was charged 1.25% and was never informed that fees were negotiable or that larger accounts typically receive discounts; (3) Client C, with $15 million in assets, was charged 1.10% but claims they should have received a greater discount given their account size compared to what other large clients receive. The firm has a practice of charging 1.40%-1.50% for accounts under $1 million, 1.25% for accounts between $1-5 million, 1.00% for accounts between $5-10 million, and 0.85%-0.95% for accounts over $10 million, but this tiered structure is not disclosed anywhere in Form ADV or in client agreements. What violations, if any, has Pacific Coast Advisers committed?

A. The firm violated its disclosure obligations by failing to accurately describe its fee structure in Form ADV Part 2A, and potentially violated anti-fraud provisions by charging Client A above the stated "standard fee" without adequate disclosure
B. The firm has not violated any regulations because Form ADV states fees are negotiable, which provides sufficient disclosure; the specific fee arrangements with individual clients are private contractual matters
C. The firm violated regulations only with respect to Client A, who was charged above the disclosed standard rate; Clients B and C have no valid complaints because they were charged at or below the stated standard fee
D. The firm must immediately reduce all client fees to the lowest rate charged to any client to avoid violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act

**Correct Answer:** A. The firm violated its disclosure obligations by failing to accurately describe its fee structure in Form ADV Part 2A, and potentially violated anti-fraud provisions by charging Client A above the stated "standard fee" without adequate disclosure

**Explanation:** Pacific Coast Advisers has committed multiple violations. Form ADV Part 2A must accurately and completely describe the adviser's fee structure. While the brochure mentions that fees are "negotiable," it fails to disclose that the firm actually operates on a tiered fee schedule based on account size, charging significantly different rates (ranging from 0.85% to 1.50%) depending on assets. This omission is material because clients cannot effectively negotiate or understand whether they're being treated fairly without knowing the actual fee structure the firm employs. The statement that "1.25% is our standard fee" is misleading when the firm routinely charges rates from 0.85% to 1.50% - there is no single "standard" fee. Regarding Client A specifically, charging 1.40% while representing this as the "standard fee" (when the brochure states 1.25% is standard) without disclosing it's above the stated standard rate likely violates anti-fraud provisions under Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act. Even though the brochure says fees are negotiable and "may be more or less," representing 1.40% as the standard fee when the disclosed standard is 1.25% is deceptive. For Client B, while they were charged the stated "standard" rate of 1.25%, the failure to disclose that this rate is actually on the higher end of the firm's range and that accounts of their size typically receive this rate while larger accounts receive substantial discounts may constitute a material omission. Client C's complaint raises issues about fair dealing - if the firm has a practice of charging 0.85%-0.95% for accounts over $10 million, charging Client C (with $15 million) only 1.10% when they could receive 0.85%-0.95% raises questions about whether the fee was truly "negotiated" fairly or whether the client was disadvantaged by inadequate disclosure. The proper remedy is for the firm to amend Form ADV Part 2A to accurately describe its tiered fee structure, provide updated brochures to all clients, potentially refund overcharges, and implement better fee disclosure practices. Option B is incorrect because merely stating fees are "negotiable" is insufficient when the firm has an established fee structure that isn't disclosed. Option C is incorrect because the violations extend beyond just Client A - the inadequate fee disclosure affects all clients' ability to negotiate fairly. Option D is incorrect because charging different fees to different clients is permissible as long as it's properly disclosed; the violation is in the inadequate disclosure, not in having varying fees.

## Question 7
Riverside Investment Management is a state-registered investment adviser with $62 million in AUM. The firm is owned entirely by its founder, Robert Chen, who also serves as the firm's Chief Compliance Officer and only investment adviser representative. Robert is considering various business developments and consults with his attorney about Form ADV filing requirements. The attorney advises him on the following scenarios: (1) Robert is negotiating to sell 40% ownership in Riverside to a private equity firm, which would provide capital for expansion while Robert retains 60% ownership and operational control; (2) Robert is considering hiring his first employee, Susan, who would serve as an administrative assistant handling client correspondence and scheduling but would not provide investment advice or have discretionary authority; (3) Robert has been approached by a local bank that wants to refer wealth management clients to Riverside in exchange for Riverside paying the bank a referral fee of 0.25% of AUM for any referred clients; (4) Robert is planning to change the firm's legal structure from a sole proprietorship to a limited liability company (LLC) for liability protection purposes; (5) Robert's brother-in-law is on the board of directors of a publicly traded technology company, and Robert occasionally recommends this stock to clients based on his own research, though his brother-in-law has never provided him with any inside information. Which of these scenarios would require Form ADV amendments or additional disclosures?

A. Scenarios (1), (3), (4), and (5) require Form ADV amendments or disclosures; scenario (2) does not require any Form ADV changes since Susan would not be providing investment advice
B. All five scenarios require some form of Form ADV amendment or disclosure because each represents a material change in the firm's operations, ownership, conflicts, or structure
C. Only scenarios (1) and (4) require Form ADV amendments because they involve changes to ownership structure; the other scenarios are operational matters that don't require disclosure
D. Scenarios (1), (3), and (4) require amendments; scenarios (2) and (5) do not require disclosure because administrative employees need not be listed and indirect family relationships to recommended securities are too attenuated to constitute conflicts

**Correct Answer:** B. All five scenarios require some form of Form ADV amendment or disclosure because each represents a material change in the firm's operations, ownership, conflicts, or structure

**Explanation:** Each scenario triggers Form ADV requirements: (1) Selling 40% ownership to a private equity firm is a material change in ownership that must be reported in Form ADV Part 1A (Schedule A - Direct Owners and Executive Officers, and Schedule B - Indirect Owners). This represents a significant change in control and ownership structure requiring an "other-than-annual amendment" within 30 days. Even though Robert retains 60% and control, the addition of a 40% owner is material. Additionally, if the private equity firm has any role in operations or imposes any restrictions, this may require additional disclosure in Part 2A. (2) Hiring Susan as the first employee requires updating Form ADV even though she won't provide investment advice. Part 1A asks about the number of employees, and going from zero employees to one employee is a material change. Additionally, if Susan will have access to client information or accounts, her role should be described in the firm's compliance structure. While she may not need to be listed as an IAR or require a Part 2B brochure supplement, the firm's organizational structure has materially changed. (3) The bank referral arrangement absolutely requires disclosure in Form ADV Part 2A under conflicts of interest and referral arrangements. This is a cash solicitation arrangement that must comply with Rule 206(4)-3 of the Investment Advisers Act, which requires: written disclosure to clients of the arrangement, written agreement with the solicitor (bank), and client acknowledgment. The arrangement must be described in Part 2A, including the fee structure and potential conflicts. Additionally, the bank employees making referrals may themselves need to be registered depending on their compensation structure. (4) Changing from a sole proprietorship to an LLC is a fundamental change in legal structure that must be reflected throughout Form ADV Part 1A. This includes changes to: Item 1 (identifying information and legal structure), Item 3 (form of organization), organizational documents, and potentially requires filing an initial application for the LLC while withdrawing the sole proprietorship registration (some states may treat this as a new registration rather than an amendment). This is a material change requiring prompt filing. (5) The brother-in-law's board position at a company Robert recommends creates a conflict of interest that should be disclosed in Form ADV Part 2A. Even though Robert doesn't receive inside information, the family relationship creates a potential conflict - clients might wonder if Robert is recommending the stock because of the family connection rather than purely objective analysis. The relationship creates an appearance of conflict that should be disclosed so clients can make informed decisions. The SEC's position is that conflicts should be disclosed broadly, including indirect relationships that could influence recommendations. Option A is incorrect because scenario (2) does require Form ADV updates regarding employee count and organizational structure. Option C is incorrect because it fails to recognize that scenarios (3) and (5) involve material conflicts and arrangements requiring disclosure, and scenario (2) involves organizational changes. Option D is incorrect because scenario (2) involves material organizational changes (first employee, changing from solo practitioner to having staff), and scenario (5) involves a conflict of interest that, while indirect, should be disclosed given the specific nature of the recommendations and family relationship. The key principle is that Form ADV requires comprehensive disclosure of material changes in ownership, structure, operations, and conflicts of interest, interpreted broadly to ensure investors have complete information.

## Question 8
Metropolitan Wealth Advisors is a federally registered investment adviser with $520 million in AUM serving 340 clients across 12 states. The firm's Form ADV Part 2A states in the "Methods of Analysis, Investment Strategies and Risk of Loss" section: "We employ a diversified investment approach using fundamental analysis of individual securities combined with modern portfolio theory. We invest primarily in publicly traded stocks and bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs. We may also use options for hedging purposes in appropriate client accounts." The compliance department discovers that over the past 18 months, one of the firm's senior portfolio managers, David, has been implementing a highly concentrated investment strategy for approximately 25 of his 60 clients, with these portfolios holding only 8-12 individual stocks (compared to the firm's typical 40-60 holdings) and using leveraged ETFs to amplify returns. Additionally, David has been actively trading options in 15 client accounts, not merely for hedging but as a primary investment strategy to generate income through covered calls and cash-secured puts, with some accounts having 30-40% of their value in options positions. None of these clients were informed that David's approach differed from the firm's stated investment methods, and the Form ADV brochure was not supplemented to describe these strategies. Several of the clients with concentrated, leveraged portfolios have experienced significant volatility, with some accounts declining 25-35% during a recent market correction while the firm's other clients following traditional strategies declined only 12-15%. How should the firm address this situation, and what are the regulatory implications?

A. The firm should immediately restrict David from continuing these strategies, amend Form ADV Part 2A to accurately describe all investment methods actually being employed, provide updated brochures to all clients, and consider whether clients affected by undisclosed strategies are entitled to remediation
B. Since Form ADV mentioned that the firm "may use options" and didn't explicitly prohibit concentrated portfolios, no Form ADV violation occurred; the firm should simply have David provide better performance reports to affected clients explaining the volatility
C. The firm should terminate David for unauthorized trading and report him to regulators, but the firm itself bears no responsibility since David acted independently against firm policy
D. The firm should amend Form ADV to add concentrated portfolios and active options trading as approved strategies, which will retroactively cure any disclosure deficiencies, and no client notification is required since Form ADV is publicly available

**Correct Answer:** A. The firm should immediately restrict David from continuing these strategies, amend Form ADV Part 2A to accurately describe all investment methods actually being employed, provide updated brochures to all clients, and consider whether clients affected by undisclosed strategies are entitled to remediation

**Explanation:** Metropolitan Wealth Advisors faces serious regulatory violations on multiple levels. First, Form ADV Part 2A must accurately describe the investment strategies the firm actually employs, not just those it intends to employ or approves of. The fact that David has been implementing concentrated, leveraged strategies with active options trading for 25-40 clients over 18 months means these are strategies the firm has been employing, whether authorized or not. The Form ADV description of "diversified investment approach" and options "for hedging purposes" is materially misleading when a significant portion of the firm's clients are in highly concentrated portfolios using leveraged ETFs and options for income generation rather than hedging. Second, the firm has violated its fiduciary duty to the affected clients by failing to provide adequate disclosure before implementing strategies that materially differ from what was disclosed in Form ADV and what clients reasonably expected. Clients who engaged the firm based on its stated "diversified approach" have been placed in concentrated, leveraged strategies without informed consent. This likely violates the antifraud provisions of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act. Third, the firm's supervision and compliance systems have failed. As a registered investment adviser, Metropolitan is responsible for supervising its IARs and ensuring they operate within disclosed parameters. The fact that David could implement these significant strategy deviations for 18 months without detection represents a failure of the firm's compliance program. Fourth, there are potential suitability issues. While investment advisers don't have formal "suitability" requirements like broker-dealers, they have a fiduciary duty to ensure recommendations and strategies are appropriate for each client's objectives, risk tolerance, and financial situation. Concentrated, leveraged portfolios may be appropriate for some sophisticated, risk-tolerant clients, but implementing them across 25 clients without documented assessment of appropriateness raises serious questions. The firm should take the following steps: (1) Immediately conduct a review of all client accounts David manages to understand the full scope of strategy deviations; (2) Suspend implementation of undisclosed strategies pending review; (3) Amend Form ADV Part 2A to accurately describe all investment strategies actually being employed (or make a definitive decision to prohibit certain strategies and enforce that prohibition); (4) Provide updated brochures to all current clients; (5) Contact affected clients to disclose that strategies employed differed from those disclosed and discuss appropriate next steps; (6) Evaluate whether clients who suffered losses due to undisclosed strategies are entitled to remediation; (7) Strengthen supervision and compliance procedures to prevent future violations; (8) Consider whether voluntary disclosure to regulators is appropriate given the seriousness of the violations. Option B is incorrect because mentioning that the firm "may use options" for hedging does not adequately disclose using options as a primary income-generation strategy with 30-40% of account values in options positions - this is a material difference. Similarly, describing a "diversified approach" is fundamentally inconsistent with concentrated 8-12 stock portfolios. Option C is incorrect because while David may have acted contrary to firm policy, the firm is responsible for supervising its IARs and is liable for their actions within the scope of their employment. The firm cannot disclaim responsibility by blaming a rogue employee - it has supervisory obligations. Option D is incorrect because amending Form ADV does not retroactively cure past disclosure deficiencies or eliminate the firm's obligation to notify affected clients of material changes. Simply making an amended Form ADV publicly available is insufficient - clients must be provided updated brochures and informed of material changes. Additionally, adding these strategies as "approved" without determining whether they should be permitted raises questions about the firm's commitment to its fiduciary obligations.

## Question 9
Golden Gate Advisory Services is a state-registered investment adviser with $48 million in AUM. The firm's Form ADV Part 1, Item 5 (Information About Your Advisory Business) shows the firm has 85 clients and reports AUM of $48 million. The firm's Part 2A brochure states: "We provide personalized investment management services tailored to each client's unique financial situation and goals. Our typical client relationship involves comprehensive financial planning and ongoing portfolio management." During a state securities examination, regulators discover that of the firm's 85 "clients": (1) 12 are family members of the firm's principals who have accounts but pay no fees and receive informal, occasional advice; (2) 8 are former clients whose accounts were closed 14-18 months ago but are still listed as clients; (3) 15 are participants in a 401(k) plan where the firm serves as adviser to the plan, but the firm counted each participant as an individual client rather than counting the plan as one client; (4) 5 are accounts belonging to the firm's principals themselves; (5) 10 are clients who pay a one-time financial planning fee but have no assets managed by the firm, yet the firm allocated a portion of its AUM to these clients in its calculation. Additionally, examiners find that the firm's actual AUM calculation includes $6 million in client assets held at custodians where the firm has no discretionary authority and provides only occasional consultative advice when clients request it. What violations has Golden Gate committed, and how should the firm correct its Form ADV?

A. The firm has materially overstated its client count and AUM in Form ADV Part 1; it should immediately file an amended Form ADV with corrected figures using proper counting methodology, which will likely show approximately 35-45 clients and approximately $42 million in AUM
B. The firm's counting methodology is acceptable because Form ADV instructions allow flexibility in how clients are counted; the firm should simply add footnotes explaining its methodology in the next annual update
C. The firm should file amended Form ADV removing only the 8 former clients (item 2) and the family members who pay no fees (item 1); all other counting methods are within regulatory guidelines
D. The firm has committed fraud by overstating AUM and should expect significant fines; all family member accounts must be immediately closed and all 401(k) participants must be dropped as clients

**Correct Answer:** A. The firm has materially overstated its client count and AUM in Form ADV Part 1; it should immediately file an amended Form ADV with corrected figures using proper counting methodology, which will likely show approximately 35-45 clients and approximately $42 million in AUM

**Explanation:** Golden Gate has significantly misstated both its client count and AUM through improper counting methodology. Let's analyze each category: (1) Family members who pay no fees and receive only occasional informal advice should not be counted as clients. A "client" for Form ADV purposes is generally someone with whom the adviser has an advisory relationship, typically formalized through an agreement and involving compensation. Counting 12 non-paying family members inflates the client count. (2) Former clients whose accounts were closed 14-18 months ago absolutely should not be counted as current clients. This is a clear misrepresentation. These 8 should be removed from the client count. (3) The 401(k) plan should be counted as one client (the plan itself), not 15 separate clients (the participants). Form ADV instructions specify that for pension and profit-sharing plans, employee benefit plans, and similar accounts, the plan itself is the client, not the individual participants. This is one of the most common Form ADV counting errors. The firm should count 1 client (the plan) instead of 15, reducing the count by 14. (4) Principals' own accounts create a gray area. Some advisers count them; others don't. The more conservative and technically correct approach is not to count proprietary accounts as "clients" since you're not providing third-party advisory services. However, this is less clear-cut than the other categories. If we count them, it's 5 clients; if we don't, reduce by 5. (5) Clients who pay one-time financial planning fees but have no managed assets are clients for client-count purposes (they received advisory services and paid for them), but they should not have any AUM allocated to them if the firm doesn't manage their assets. The firm appears to have improperly allocated $6 million or some portion of AUM to these planning-only clients. Additionally, the $6 million in non-discretionary consultative assets should not be included in regulatory AUM for Form ADV Part 1. Form ADV instructions generally require reporting "regulatory assets under management," which includes assets for which the firm has continuous and regular supervisory or management services. Assets where the firm merely provides occasional consultative advice when asked typically should not be included. Let's calculate corrected figures: Starting with 85 reported "clients": - Subtract 12 non-paying family members = 73 - Subtract 8 former clients = 65 - Subtract 14 (counting 401(k) plan as 1 instead of 15) = 51 - Subtract 5 principals' accounts (conservative approach) = 46 - Keep 10 financial planning clients (they are legitimate clients) = 46 clients So the corrected client count is approximately 46 clients (or 51 if principals' accounts are counted). For AUM: Starting with $48 million reported: - Subtract $6 million in non-discretionary consultative assets = $42 million - The financial planning clients shouldn't contribute to AUM if the firm doesn't manage their assets, but it's unclear from the facts whether any of the $48 million was improperly allocated to them. If some was, subtract that as well. Corrected AUM is approximately $42 million or potentially less. The firm should immediately file an "other-than-annual amendment" correcting these figures. This is material misinformation that has been reported to regulators. The violations stem from improper counting methodology, likely due to misunderstanding Form ADV instructions rather than intentional fraud (though materiality is significant). The firm should: (1) Review Form ADV instructions for counting clients and calculating AUM; (2) Recalculate using proper methodology; (3) File corrected Form ADV Part 1 immediately; (4) Consider whether the misstatements affect the firm's registration status (at $42 million, still well below federal registration thresholds, so likely no status change); (5) Implement better compliance procedures for annual ADV updates. Option B is incorrect because Form ADV instructions provide specific guidance on client counting (e.g., plans are one client, not individual participants), and the firm's methodology violates these instructions. Footnotes don't cure material misstatements. Option C is incorrect because the 401(k) counting error (item 3), non-discretionary asset inclusion, and non-paying family members all represent violations beyond just former clients. Option D is incorrect because there's no requirement to close family accounts or drop 401(k) participants - the firm should simply count them correctly (1 plan = 1 client, and family members can be clients if there's a genuine advisory relationship with proper agreements and fees).

## Question 10
Clearwater Financial Advisors is a federally registered investment adviser with $380 million in AUM. The firm's Form ADV Part 2A includes standard disclosures about the firm's advisory services, fees, conflicts of interest, and disciplinary history. In the conflicts of interest section, the brochure states: "From time to time, our firm or our personnel may have conflicts of interest with clients. We strive to act in our clients' best interests at all times and will disclose material conflicts as they arise." During the annual updating amendment process, the Chief Compliance Officer reviews the following situations that have developed over the past year to determine if additional specific disclosures are required: (1) The firm's founder and CEO purchased a 10% ownership stake in a startup robo-advisory technology company that competes directly with traditional financial advisors by offering automated investment management at much lower fees than Clearwater charges; (2) Three of the firm's investment adviser representatives are also registered representatives of a broker-dealer and occasionally recommend that clients roll over 401(k) plans from former employers into IRAs at that broker-dealer, where the IARs receive 12b-1 trailer fees on mutual funds held in the IRAs; (3) The firm's director of research owns $400,000 worth of stock in a publicly traded company that the firm frequently recommends to clients and includes in many client portfolios; this holding represents approximately 35% of the research director's personal investment portfolio; (4) The firm has begun accepting compensation from a mutual fund company for educating clients about that fund company's products, including hosting webinars and producing educational content; the fund company pays the firm $50,000 annually for these services; (5) Two partners in the firm serve as trustees for several clients' family trusts, for which they receive trustee fees of $15,000-$25,000 per year per trust; (6) The firm's portfolio management software is provided at no cost by a broker-dealer in exchange for Clearwater directing a minimum dollar amount of client trades to that broker-dealer each quarter. Which of these situations require specific disclosure in Form ADV Part 2A beyond the general conflicts statement already included?

A. All six situations (1-6) require specific disclosure in Form ADV Part 2A because each represents a material conflict of interest that goes beyond general, boilerplate conflict statements
B. Only situations (2), (4), and (6) require disclosure because they involve direct compensation arrangements; situations (1), (3), and (5) are personal matters that don't require firm-level disclosure
C. Situations (2), (3), (4), and (6) require disclosure; situations (1) and (5) don't require disclosure because the CEO's personal investments and partner trustee fees are outside the scope of the advisory business
D. Only situation (6) requires disclosure as a soft-dollar arrangement; the other situations are covered by the general conflicts disclosure already in the brochure

**Correct Answer:** A. All six situations (1-6) require specific disclosure in Form ADV Part 2A because each represents a material conflict of interest that goes beyond general, boilerplate conflict statements

**Explanation:** Form ADV Part 2A requires specific, detailed disclosure of material conflicts of interest. General statements like "we may have conflicts and will disclose them" are insufficient. Each situation must be specifically disclosed: (1) The CEO's 10% ownership in a competing robo-advisory company is a significant conflict that must be disclosed. Clients have a right to know that the firm's leader has a financial interest in a business model that competes with and potentially undermines the firm's traditional advisory services. This creates questions about whether the CEO is fully committed to the firm's success or might be conflicted in strategic decisions. This should be disclosed in the conflicts section and potentially under "Other Financial Industry Activities and Affiliations." (2) The dual registration of IARs as broker-dealer registered representatives and receipt of 12b-1 fees must be disclosed. This is a classic conflict - the IARs have a financial incentive to recommend IRA rollovers to the affiliated broker-dealer rather than potentially lower-cost alternatives, and they receive ongoing compensation (trailer fees) based on assets in those IRAs. This must be disclosed under conflicts and potentially in a separate section addressing IARs' other business activities. Rule 206(4)-1 (advertising rule) and various SEC guidance require clear disclosure of compensation arrangements that could influence recommendations. (3) The research director's $400,000 holding (35% of personal portfolio) in a stock the firm frequently recommends is a material conflict requiring disclosure. The research director has a significant personal financial interest in a security the firm recommends - clients should know this because it raises questions about whether recommendations are objective or influenced by the director's personal holdings. While investment personnel often own securities they recommend, a holding this large (35% of personal portfolio, $400,000) in a frequently recommended stock is material and must be disclosed. (4) Accepting $50,000 annually from a mutual fund company for educational services is absolutely a material conflict requiring disclosure. This creates an incentive to favor that fund company's products in recommendations. Even if the educational content is objective, clients must know about this financial relationship. This should be disclosed prominently in the conflicts section and potentially under "Other Financial Industry Activities and Affiliations." (5) Partners serving as paid trustees for client trusts creates multiple conflicts: the partners receive trustee fees from clients (additional compensation beyond advisory fees), and they may have authority over trust assets while also advising on those assets, creating potential self-dealing opportunities. This must be disclosed so clients can understand the full compensation arrangements and potential conflicts. This should be disclosed under conflicts and potentially under fees. (6) Receiving portfolio management software at no cost in exchange for directing a minimum dollar amount of trades is a soft-dollar arrangement that must be disclosed in detail. Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act and related SEC guidance require extensive disclosure of soft-dollar arrangements, including what benefits the adviser receives, how this might result in higher client costs (if trades are directed based on software receipt rather than best execution), and how the arrangement might create conflicts. This should be disclosed in a detailed soft-dollar section in Form ADV Part 2A. Option B is incorrect because situation (1) involves material financial interests in a competing business model, situation (3) involves significant personal holdings in recommended securities, and situation (5) involves direct compensation from clients beyond advisory fees - all require disclosure. Option C is incorrect because situation (1) - the CEO owning 10% of a competing firm - is material to the advisory business and creates conflicts around strategic direction and commitment, requiring disclosure. Situation (5) creates direct conflicts when partners serve as both advisers and trustees for the same clients, receiving multiple forms of compensation. Option D is grossly incorrect because it suggests only one of six significant conflicts requires disclosure, and it wrongly claims general conflict boilerplate is sufficient. The key principle: Form ADV requires specific, detailed disclosure of each material conflict. General, boilerplate language stating "conflicts may exist" is inadequate. Clients must be informed of actual, specific conflicts so they can make informed decisions about the advisory relationship and evaluate whether the adviser is appropriately managing conflicts.

## Question 11
Northern Lights Investment Counsel is a state-registered investment adviser in Michigan with $68 million in AUM. The firm has clients in Michigan (72 clients), Ohio (8 clients), Indiana (4 clients), Illinois (2 clients), and Wisconsin (1 client). The firm maintains its only office in Michigan. All clients in other states were obtained through referrals from existing clients; the firm has never advertised or solicited business outside of Michigan. The firm is registered with Michigan securities regulators but has never registered in any other state, relying on the de minimis exemption. Last month, the firm's founder, Karen, gave a presentation at a financial planning conference held in Chicago, Illinois, where she spoke about tax-efficient investing strategies. During the presentation, she mentioned her firm's name and showed her contact information on slides. Following the conference, 15 people from various states (including 6 from Illinois, 4 from Indiana, 3 from Ohio, and 2 from Wisconsin) contacted Karen expressing interest in becoming clients. Karen is excited about the potential for growth and wants to accept all 15 as new clients. Her compliance consultant warns her that accepting these clients would have registration implications. Specifically, what are Northern Lights' registration obligations if Karen accepts all 15 new clients?

A. Northern Lights must register in Ohio and Illinois where the combined existing plus new clients would exceed 5, but can continue relying on the de minimis exemption in Indiana and Wisconsin
B. Northern Lights must register in all four states (Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin) because Karen's conference presentation constitutes "holding out" as an investment adviser in Illinois, which vitiates the de minimis exemption in all states
C. Northern Lights need not register in any additional states because all inquiries were unsolicited responses to an educational presentation, preserving the de minimis exemption
D. Northern Lights must register with the SEC rather than individual states because accepting these clients would bring the firm to 102 clients across 6 states, triggering federal registration requirements

**Correct Answer:** B. Northern Lights must register in all four states (Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin) because Karen's conference presentation constitutes "holding out" as an investment adviser in Illinois, which vitiates the de minimis exemption in all states

**Explanation:** The de minimis exemption allows investment advisers to have up to 5 clients in a state during a 12-month period without registering in that state, provided two critical conditions are met: (1) the adviser has no place of business in that state, AND (2) the adviser does not hold itself out generally to the public in that state as an investment adviser. Northern Lights currently satisfies both prongs in Ohio (8 clients but no office and presumably no holding out), Indiana (4 clients), Illinois (2 clients), and Wisconsin (1 client). However, the de minimis exemption is lost even if an adviser has fewer than 5 clients if the adviser "holds out" to the public as an investment adviser in that state. Karen's presentation at a financial planning conference in Chicago where she displayed her firm name and contact information constitutes "holding out" in Illinois. By speaking at a public conference, identifying her firm, and providing contact information, she held herself out as an investment adviser to the public in Illinois. Once the "holding out" prong of the de minimis exemption is violated, the exemption is lost regardless of client count. This means Northern Lights cannot rely on the de minimis exemption in Illinois even if it had zero clients there. Moreover, the "holding out" violation in Illinois has broader implications. Different states and securities attorneys interpret the scope differently, but the most conservative and legally sound interpretation is that once an adviser holds itself out at a public event in one state, attendees from multiple states are exposed to that holding out. The 15 people who contacted Karen came from the conference where she held out - they became aware of Northern Lights specifically because of Karen's public presentation. Therefore, Northern Lights cannot claim it didn't hold out to these prospective clients; they learned of the firm through a public holding-out event. If Northern Lights accepts new clients: Ohio would have 8 + 3 = 11 clients; Illinois would have 2 + 6 = 8 clients; Indiana would have 4 + 4 = 8 clients; Wisconsin would have 1 + 2 = 3 clients. Ohio: 11 clients exceeds the 5-client limit, and the adviser may have lost the de minimis exemption through holding out. Must register. Illinois: 8 clients exceeds 5, AND the adviser held out in Illinois. Must register. Indiana: 8 clients exceeds 5, and arguably the clients resulted from holding out. Must register. Wisconsin: 3 clients is under 5, but if the clients resulted from the holding-out event, the exemption may be lost. The safest course is to register or not accept Wisconsin clients from the conference. Option A is incorrect because it fails to account for the "holding out" violation, which affects the exemption in all states, not just where client counts exceed 5. Option C is incorrect because even though the inquiries were "unsolicited" in the sense that Karen didn't directly solicit these specific individuals, they resulted from her public presentation where she held out as an investment adviser - this vitiates the de minimis exemption. The exemption requires both fewer than 5 clients AND no holding out; violating the holding-out prong defeats the exemption even with unsolicited inquiries. Option D is incorrect regarding SEC registration triggers - having 102 clients across 6 states doesn't trigger federal registration; AUM thresholds do. At $68 million AUM, Northern Lights is well below the $100 million threshold and must remain state-registered. The correct course of action: If Karen wants to accept these clients, Northern Lights should register in Ohio and Illinois immediately (where they'll exceed 5 clients), evaluate registration requirements in Indiana (where they'll exceed 5 clients), and carefully consider whether to register in Wisconsin or decline those prospective clients. Alternatively, Northern Lights could limit how many new clients it accepts from each state to stay under 5 in states where registration is complex or expensive, but even this strategy is risky given the holding-out violation. The lesson: Investment advisers must be extremely cautious about public speaking, advertising, or any activity that could constitute "holding out" in states where they're not registered and are relying on the de minimis exemption. Publishing articles, speaking at conferences, appearing on local media, or similar public activities can vitiate the de minimis exemption even with zero clients in a state.

## Question 12
Sequoia Asset Management is a federally registered investment adviser with $650 million in AUM. The firm's Form ADV Part 2A describes the firm's custody practices as follows: "We do not maintain custody of client funds or securities. All client assets are held at qualified custodians, and clients receive account statements directly from those custodians. We recommend that clients carefully review their custodian statements." However, during an SEC examination, examiners discover several situations that may constitute "custody" under SEC rules: (1) The firm has been given written authorization by 12 clients to deduct advisory fees directly from their accounts at the custodian, with fees being withdrawn quarterly; (2) The firm's managing partner serves as trustee for 8 family trusts that are clients of the firm, giving him legal authority over the trust assets; (3) The firm has standing letters of authorization (SLOAs) from 18 clients authorizing the firm to direct the custodian to transfer funds from the clients' accounts to specified third parties (such as for charitable contributions or distributions to family members); (4) The firm uses a third-party portfolio accounting system that has a "trade-away" arrangement where trades are executed at one broker but settled at the custodian; the firm has login credentials that allow it to view client account information at the custodian and initiate certain administrative actions, though it cannot directly move money; (5) Six clients have given the firm's principals power of attorney over their financial affairs due to the clients' advanced age and health issues, and these POAs allow the principals to sign checks and make withdrawals on behalf of the clients. Based on these facts, does Sequoia actually have custody of client assets, and if so, what are the firm's compliance obligations under the Custody Rule?

A. Sequoia has custody due to situations (1), (2), (3), and (5); the firm must comply with the Custody Rule including obtaining annual surprise examinations by an independent accountant and ensuring clients receive account statements from qualified custodians
B. Sequoia does not have custody because all assets are held at qualified custodians and the firm cannot directly access client funds; the situations described are normal administrative arrangements that don't constitute custody
C. Sequoia has custody only for situations (2) and (5) where personnel have legal authority over client assets; situations (1), (3), and (4) are operational matters that don't trigger custody obligations
D. Sequoia must immediately terminate all arrangements that create custody and revise Form ADV to ensure it has no custody, as federal advisers cannot maintain custody of client assets

**Correct Answer:** A. Sequoia has custody due to situations (1), (2), (3), and (5); the firm must comply with the Custody Rule including obtaining annual surprise examinations by an independent accountant and ensuring clients receive account statements from qualified custodians

**Explanation:** The SEC's Custody Rule (Rule 206(4)-2) defines "custody" broadly to include situations where an adviser holds client funds or securities, or has authority to obtain possession of them. Sequoia's situations trigger custody as follows: (1) Direct fee deduction: Having written authorization to deduct fees directly from client accounts is a form of custody under the rule. While this is a limited form of custody (the adviser can only deduct its own fees, not access funds otherwise), it still constitutes custody. However, there's a specific exception: if the adviser has written authorization from the client, the custodian sends account statements directly to clients, and the adviser has a reasonable belief that clients are receiving statements, the adviser can deduct fees without triggering the full surprise examination requirement. So situation (1) creates custody but may qualify for an exception from some custody requirements if properly structured. (2) Serving as trustee: When the firm's personnel serve as trustees for client trusts, the firm is deemed to have custody of the trust assets. This is one of the most common ways advisers inadvertently obtain custody. The trustee has legal authority over the assets, which constitutes custody under the rule. This absolutely triggers full Custody Rule compliance obligations. (3) Standing Letters of Authorization (SLOAs): This is a developing area of custody rule interpretation. Traditionally, having authority to direct custodians to send client funds to third parties was considered custody. However, the SEC issued a no-action letter (February 2017) providing conditions under which SLOAs don't constitute custody: the client provides written authorization, the transfer is to a specific third party (not the adviser), the custodian verifies the client's instruction, the custodian sends confirmation to the client, the adviser maintains records, and the client can terminate the authorization. If Sequoia's SLOAs meet all these conditions, they may not constitute custody; if they don't meet all conditions, they do constitute custody. Given the facts don't specify whether these conditions are met, situation (3) likely constitutes custody. (4) Login credentials and administrative access: Merely having view-only access or administrative capabilities (like correcting addresses) typically doesn't constitute custody as long as the adviser can't directly move money or securities. Situation (4) likely does not constitute custody if the access is truly limited to viewing and administrative functions. However, if the login credentials allow the firm to initiate transfers or withdrawals (even with custodian approval steps), this could constitute custody. (5) Power of Attorney with financial authority: Having POA that allows signing checks and making withdrawals is definitely custody under the rule. The firm has legal authority to obtain possession of client funds, which is the definition of custody. If Sequoia has custody (which it does through situations 1, 2, 3, and 5), it must comply with the Custody Rule requirements: (a) Client funds and securities must be maintained by a qualified custodian; (b) If the adviser or related persons serve as qualified custodian, clients must receive account statements at least quarterly; (c) If a third party serves as qualified custodian, the custodian must send account statements directly to clients at least quarterly; (d) The adviser must undergo an annual surprise examination by an independent public accountant (with some exceptions, such as the fee deduction exception if properly structured); (e) The adviser must file Form ADV-E annually. There are some exceptions. For situation (1) (fee deduction), if Sequoia has proper written authorization, the custodian sends statements, and Sequoia has reasonable belief clients receive them, the surprise examination requirement may not apply to these accounts. For situation (2) (trustee), if the trustee is subject to regular audit by an independent accountant, the surprise exam requirement may not apply. However, Sequoia has still been deficient by stating in Form ADV that it doesn't have custody when in fact it does. The firm must: (1) Amend Form ADV to accurately disclose that it has custody; (2) Review each custody situation to determine applicable compliance obligations; (3) Implement surprise examination by independent accountant (unless exceptions apply); (4) Verify clients receive account statements from custodians; (5) File Form ADV-E annually; (6) Implement controls to track and monitor all situations that may create custody. Option B is incorrect because custody is defined by authority over assets, not just physical possession. Many of Sequoia's arrangements constitute custody even though assets are at third-party custodians. Option C is incorrect because situations (1) and (3) also trigger custody (though (1) may qualify for exceptions). Option D is incorrect because federal advisers can maintain custody; they just must comply with the Custody Rule requirements. There's no prohibition on advisers having custody - it simply triggers specific compliance obligations.

## Question 13
Pinnacle Retirement Advisors is a state-registered investment adviser with $55 million in AUM, specializing in retirement planning for individuals approaching retirement. The firm's Form ADV Part 2A includes this statement in the "Types of Clients" section: "We primarily serve individuals and families who are within 10 years of retirement or already retired. We generally require a minimum account size of $500,000 for portfolio management services." In the "Advisory Business" section, the brochure states: "We offer comprehensive retirement planning services including Social Security optimization analysis, pension distribution planning, Medicare planning, estate planning coordination, and ongoing investment management." The firm's CCO is reviewing several client situations that have developed recently: (1) The firm accepted a new client, Thomas (age 42), with $600,000 in investable assets even though he is 23 years from retirement, because he is a referral from an important existing client and paid an upfront financial planning fee of $5,000; (2) The firm accepted Susan (age 68) as a client even though she has only $200,000 in assets, waiving the minimum because she is a longtime friend of one of the firm's partners; (3) The firm has begun offering a new service - tax return preparation - for clients, charging $750-$1,500 per return, but this service is not mentioned anywhere in Form ADV; (4) The firm accepted a small business (a medical practice with 4 doctors) as a client to manage the practice's profit-sharing plan ($2.5 million in assets), even though the firm's brochure says it serves "individuals and families" and doesn't mention retirement plan services; (5) The firm has started offering hourly consultations ($350/hour) to individuals who don't meet the $500,000 minimum, providing advice on specific questions without ongoing portfolio management, but this service offering isn't described in the brochure. Do these situations create Form ADV disclosure issues, and what corrections are needed?

A. None of these situations require Form ADV amendments because minimum account sizes and target client descriptions are guidelines rather than requirements; firms have flexibility to accept clients who don't fit standard profiles
B. Situations (3), (4), and (5) require Form ADV amendments to add services and client types not currently disclosed; situations (1) and (2) don't require amendments because occasionally accepting clients outside stated parameters is acceptable with documented justification
C. All five situations create disclosure problems because Form ADV must accurately describe the firm's actual business practices; accepting clients and offering services that deviate from Form ADV descriptions requires either amending Form ADV or declining the business
D. Situations (1) and (2) violate minimum account size requirements and must be corrected by raising these clients' fees or terminating the relationships; situations (3), (4), and (5) require Form ADV amendments to add new services

**Correct Answer:** B. Situations (3), (4), and (5) require Form ADV amendments to add services and client types not currently disclosed; situations (1) and (2) don't require amendments because occasionally accepting clients outside stated parameters is acceptable with documented justification

**Explanation:** This question addresses the balance between Form ADV as a disclosure document and the flexibility firms need in their business practices. Analysis: (1) Accepting Thomas (age 42, outside the "within 10 years of retirement" target): While Pinnacle's brochure says it "primarily" serves clients approaching or in retirement, this doesn't mean it exclusively serves such clients. The word "primarily" provides flexibility. Accepting an occasional client who doesn't fit the typical profile, particularly when there's a legitimate reason (important referral, paid upfront fee for financial planning), doesn't necessarily require Form ADV amendment. However, if the firm starts regularly accepting clients well outside its stated target demographic, it should update Form ADV to accurately describe its client base. One client who is 23 years from retirement, out of presumably 100+ clients who fit the profile, is unlikely to require Form ADV changes. The firm should document why this exception was made. (2) Accepting Susan with $200,000 (below the $500,000 minimum): Form ADV can state account minimums and then note that minimums may be waived at the firm's discretion. Many firms do exactly this. The key is that stating "$500,000 minimum" doesn't mean every single client must meet this threshold - it means this is the general policy with exceptions allowed. However, if the firm finds itself frequently waiving the minimum, the stated minimum becomes misleading and should be adjusted or the disclosure should clarify that waivers are common. Accepting one friend-of-a-partner client below the minimum, out of many who meet it, is unlikely to require Form ADV amendment. Again, the decision should be documented. (3) Tax return preparation services: This is a new service not mentioned in Form ADV. While related to financial planning and retirement planning, tax preparation is distinct enough that it should be specifically disclosed in Form ADV Part 2A under the "Advisory Business" section. Clients and prospective clients should know the firm offers this service. This requires Form ADV amendment to add tax preparation to the services description and to disclose the fee structure. (4) Accepting a business client (medical practice retirement plan): Form ADV states Pinnacle serves "individuals and families" with no mention of businesses or retirement plans. Accepting a $2.5 million profit-sharing plan is significant business and represents a materially different client type. This requires Form ADV amendment to update the "Types of Clients" section to include pension and profit-sharing plans or businesses. Additionally, the "Advisory Business" section should describe retirement plan advisory services. (5) Hourly consultations for clients below the minimum: This is a new service model not described in Form ADV. The brochure describes "comprehensive retirement planning services" and "ongoing investment management" but doesn't mention hourly consultations. This different service offering (unbundled, hourly advice) should be disclosed in Form ADV, including the hourly rate and how it differs from the comprehensive service model. This requires Form ADV amendment to the "Advisory Business" section and potentially to the "Fees and Compensation" section. Option A is incorrect because Form ADV isn't merely "guidelines" - it's a regulatory disclosure document that must accurately describe the firm's business. While some flexibility exists for occasional exceptions (situations 1 and 2), material new services (situations 3, 4, and 5) require disclosure. Option C is too strict - it would require Form ADV amendments every time a single client outside normal parameters is accepted, which is impractical and unnecessary. Firms can have target client profiles while occasionally accepting outliers, as long as the exceptions don't become the rule. Option D is incorrect in asserting that accepting clients below stated minimums violates "requirements" - minimums are the firm's own policy, not regulatory requirements, and can be waived with documentation. However, D is correct that situations 3, 4, and 5 require amendments. The key principle: Form ADV must accurately describe the firm's business practices, but "accurately describe" doesn't mean "describe with perfect precision every possible variation." Firms can state they "primarily" serve a type of client while occasionally serving others. They can state account minimums while sometimes waiving them. However, when firms add materially new services (tax prep, hourly consulting) or materially new client types (retirement plans), these changes must be reflected in Form ADV. The test is: Would a reasonable client or prospective client be misled by the current Form ADV description given the firm's actual practices? If yes, amendment is required.

## Question 14
Apex Wealth Management is a federally registered investment adviser with $420 million in AUM. The firm's Form ADV Part 2A discloses that the firm is independently owned and operated. The brochure does not mention any affiliations with other financial services companies. However, regulators discover the following ownership and affiliation structure: (1) Apex Wealth Management is 100% owned by Apex Financial Holdings, LLC, a holding company that is not itself registered as an investment adviser; (2) Apex Financial Holdings also owns 100% of Apex Insurance Services, a licensed insurance agency where 4 of Apex Wealth's 10 investment adviser representatives are also licensed insurance agents and earn commissions on insurance products sold to clients; (3) Apex Financial Holdings owns 40% of a local mortgage brokerage company, Hometown Mortgage, and Apex Wealth advisers occasionally refer clients who need mortgages to Hometown (no referral fees are exchanged, but the advisers know their parent company benefits from Hometown's success); (4) The CEO of Apex Wealth Management, Richard, personally owns 100% of a property and casualty insurance agency (separate from Apex Insurance Services) and occasionally recommends this agency to clients for auto and home insurance; (5) Two of Apex Wealth's IARs are also CPAs who maintain separate CPA practices where they provide tax preparation and accounting services to some of the same individuals who are wealth management clients, earning separate fees for CPA services. None of these relationships, ownership structures, or affiliations are disclosed in Apex's current Form ADV Part 2A. What Form ADV disclosure violations has Apex committed, and what specific disclosures are required?

A. Apex must disclose all five situations in Form ADV Part 2A because each represents a material conflict of interest or affiliated business relationship that clients should know about
B. Only situations (2) and (3) require disclosure because they involve corporate affiliations; situations (1), (4), and (5) involve separate businesses or personal matters that don't require firm-level disclosure
C. All situations create disclosure violations, but the most serious is situation (1) because failing to disclose that the firm is owned by a holding company that owns other financial services businesses is a material omission that misrepresents the firm's independence
D. Situations (2), (3), (4), and (5) require disclosure under "Other Financial Industry Activities and Affiliations," but situation (1) doesn't require disclosure because ownership by a holding company doesn't affect day-to-day operations

**Correct Answer:** A. Apex must disclose all five situations in Form ADV Part 2A because each represents a material conflict of interest or affiliated business relationship that clients should know about

**Explanation:** Apex has committed serious Form ADV disclosure violations by omitting material information about ownership structure, affiliations, and conflicts of interest. Each situation requires specific disclosure: (1) Ownership by holding company: Form ADV Part 1A Schedule A requires disclosure of all direct and indirect owners. If Apex is owned by Apex Financial Holdings, this must be disclosed. More importantly for Part 2A, the brochure currently represents that the firm is "independently owned and operated," which is misleading if it's actually owned by a holding company that also owns affiliated financial services businesses. The ownership structure creates potential conflicts - decisions about the advisory firm might be influenced by the interests of affiliated insurance and mortgage companies. This must be disclosed in Part 2A, likely under "Other Financial Industry Activities and Affiliations" or a separate ownership disclosure section. The firm should disclose: "Apex Wealth Management is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apex Financial Holdings, LLC, which also owns Apex Insurance Services and holds a 40% interest in Hometown Mortgage. These affiliations create potential conflicts of interest which are described below." (2) Common ownership with insurance agency: This is a material affiliation that absolutely must be disclosed. Four of ten IARs are licensed with the affiliated insurance agency and earn commissions - this creates obvious conflicts. Clients might be steered toward insurance products that benefit the IAR through commissions and benefit the parent holding company through the insurance agency's profits. This must be prominently disclosed in Part 2A under "Other Financial Industry Activities and Affiliations" and under conflicts of interest. The disclosure should explain: the common ownership, which IARs are licensed insurance agents, how they're compensated on insurance sales, and how this creates conflicts. (3) Parent company's 40% ownership of mortgage brokerage: Even though no referral fees are paid directly to Apex or its advisers, the fact that the parent company owns 40% of the mortgage brokerage creates a conflict when Apex advisers refer clients to Hometown Mortgage. The advisers know their referrals benefit a company in which their ultimate parent has a significant financial stake. This must be disclosed under affiliations and conflicts. The disclosure should note: "Our parent company owns 40% of Hometown Mortgage. When our advisers refer clients to Hometown Mortgage, our parent company may benefit financially from the mortgage business, creating a conflict of interest." (4) CEO's personal ownership of P&C insurance agency: When the CEO personally owns a business to which he refers clients, this is a material conflict requiring disclosure. Clients should know that the person running their investment adviser firm also personally profits when they purchase insurance from a company he recommends. This should be disclosed under conflicts of interest and potentially under "Other Financial Industry Activities and Affiliations." The disclosure might state: "Our CEO owns a separate property and casualty insurance agency. When he recommends this agency to clients, he has a conflict of interest because he benefits personally from client purchases." (5) IARs with separate CPA practices: When IARs provide separate professional services (CPA services) to the same clients and receive separate compensation, this must be disclosed. It creates potential conflicts - the IAR might emphasize the value of tax services to justify fees, might provide different quality advice to clients who hire them for both services, or might have conflicts between their duties as adviser and as tax preparer. This should be disclosed under "Other Financial Industry Activities and Affiliations" and conflicts. The disclosure should identify which IARs are CPAs, note they provide separate tax services for separate fees, and explain potential conflicts. Option B is incorrect because all situations involve conflicts or affiliations requiring disclosure. Situation (1) is arguably the most material because it affects the firm's entire ownership structure. Situations (4) and (5), while involving individuals' separate activities, create conflicts when those individuals are firm principals or advisers recommending their own services to clients. Option C correctly identifies situation (1) as very serious (misrepresenting independence) but incorrectly suggests other situations are less important - all require disclosure. Option D is backward - situation (1) absolutely requires disclosure because ownership structure is fundamental information, and the holding company's ownership of affiliated financial businesses is material. The correct approach: Apex must immediately amend Form ADV to: (1) Correct the misleading "independently owned" statement; (2) Disclose the complete ownership structure including Apex Financial Holdings and its other holdings; (3) Add an "Other Financial Industry Activities and Affiliations" section detailing all related businesses; (4) Add specific conflict disclosures for each situation explaining how the affiliation or relationship creates conflicts and how the firm addresses those conflicts; (5) Consider whether individual IAR brochure supplements (Form ADV Part 2B) need similar disclosures for IARs with insurance licenses or CPA practices; (6) Implement policies and procedures to identify and disclose future affiliations and conflicts. The violations here are serious because they go to fundamental issues of independence, conflicts, and full disclosure - core fiduciary principles.

## Question 15
Mountain Ridge Advisors is a state-registered investment adviser in Colorado with $72 million in AUM. The firm files its annual updating amendment to Form ADV in March 2025. The Form ADV Part 1A Item 5.F reports "Number of employees: 14" and Item 5.D(1) reports "Number of clients: 118." In September 2025 (six months after the annual update), the following events occur: (1) The firm acquires a smaller advisory practice, absorbing 35 new clients and 3 new employees (2 IARs and 1 administrative staff), bringing totals to 153 clients and 17 employees; (2) The firm's AUM grows from $72 million to $94 million due to market appreciation and the acquired clients; (3) One of the newly hired IARs from the acquired firm discloses that he has a 5-year-old misdemeanor conviction for DUI that was not previously disclosed to Mountain Ridge or filed on Form ADV (the conviction occurred before he joined the acquired firm); (4) Mountain Ridge changes its custodian relationship from Custodian A to Custodian B for all client accounts, requiring all clients to transfer their accounts to the new custodian; (5) The firm's lease expires and it moves to a new office location three blocks away in the same city. Which of these events require Mountain Ridge to file "other-than-annual amendments" to Form ADV before the next annual updating amendment, and what is the deadline for such amendments?

A. Events (1), (3), (4), and (5) require other-than-annual amendments within 30 days; event (2) (AUM increase) can wait for the next annual updating amendment
B. Events (1) and (5) require other-than-annual amendments within 30 days; events (2), (3), and (4) can be disclosed in the next annual update
C. Events (1), (3), and (5) require other-than-annual amendments within 30 days; events (2) and (4) can wait for the annual update
D. All five events require other-than-annual amendments within 30 days because each makes information in Form ADV inaccurate

**Correct Answer:** C. Events (1), (3), and (5) require other-than-annual amendments within 30 days; events (2) and (4) can wait for the annual update

**Explanation:** Investment advisers must file "other-than-annual amendments" to Form ADV within 30 days when information in Part 1A becomes inaccurate. However, not every change requires immediate amendment - the specific Form ADV instructions determine which items trigger 30-day amendments versus which can wait for the annual update. Let's analyze each event: (1) Acquiring 35 clients and 3 employees: Form ADV Part 1A Item 5.D asks for number of clients and Item 5.F asks for number of employees. The instructions require amendments when this information becomes inaccurate. Going from 118 to 153 clients (+30%) and from 14 to 17 employees (+21%) are significant changes that make the filed information inaccurate. This requires an "other-than-annual amendment" within 30 days. Additionally, if the acquired firm's IARs are joining Mountain Ridge as IARs, they must be added to Form ADV Schedule A within 30 days. (2) AUM growth from $72M to $94M: Form ADV Part 1A Item 5.F asks about regulatory assets under management. The instructions state that advisers must update AUM information in the annual updating amendment but are not required to amend between annual updates solely for changes in AUM amounts (unless the change affects registration status, such as crossing thresholds for state vs. federal registration). Since Mountain Ridge remains eligible for state registration at $94M (below the $100M federal threshold), this AUM change does NOT require an other-than-annual amendment. It will be updated in the next annual updating amendment in March 2026. (3) Newly hired IAR's DUI conviction: Disciplinary events must be disclosed on Form ADV through Disclosure Reporting Pages (DRPs). When Mountain Ridge learns that a covered person has a disciplinary event that should have been disclosed, the firm must file an amendment adding the DRP within 30 days. A misdemeanor conviction within 10 years is potentially reportable depending on the specifics (some criminal matters are reportable regardless of whether they're investment-related). The fact that it happened before the person joined Mountain Ridge doesn't eliminate the disclosure requirement - covered persons must disclose relevant disciplinary history for the past 10 years. Upon discovering this undisclosed conviction, Mountain Ridge must determine if it's reportable under Form ADV instructions, and if so, file an amendment with the appropriate DRP within 30 days. (4) Changing custodians: This is an interesting question. Form ADV Part 1A Item 9 asks about custody arrangements and whether the adviser maintains custody. Form ADV Part 2A must disclose custodian arrangements in the brochure. However, changing from one third-party qualified custodian to another typically doesn't require an immediate Part 1A amendment if the fundamental custody situation hasn't changed (i.e., the adviser still doesn't have custody and uses a qualified custodian - just a different one). The custodian change should be reflected in the next update to Form ADV Part 2A, and clients should be notified of the change (this is typically required by the custodian transfer process and client agreements). So while this is important and requires client notification and eventual Form ADV updates, it likely does NOT trigger a mandatory 30-day other-than-annual amendment to Part 1A. It would be good practice to update Part 2A when the change occurs and provide updated brochures to clients, but this isn't strictly mandated as a 30-day Part 1A amendment. (5) Moving office to new address: Changes in the adviser's principal office address absolutely require Form ADV Part 1A amendments within 30 days. This is explicitly stated in Form ADV instructions - address changes make the filed information inaccurate and must be corrected promptly. Even moving three blocks away requires an amendment because the street address has changed. The 30-day amendment deadline applies. Summary of deadlines: Event (1): Other-than-annual amendment required within 30 days (client count, employee count, new IARs). Event (2): No immediate amendment required; update in next annual amendment (AUM change not affecting registration status). Event (3): Other-than-annual amendment required within 30 days (disciplinary disclosure). Event (4): No immediate Part 1A amendment required (operational change in custodian); update Part 2A when convenient and at next annual update. Event (5): Other-than-annual amendment required within 30 days (principal office address change). Option A is incorrect because event (4) doesn't require a 30-day amendment, and event (2) doesn't require immediate amendment for AUM changes unless they affect registration status. Option B is incorrect because it suggests only events (1) and (5) require immediate amendments, missing event (3) (disciplinary disclosure, which is required within 30 days). Option D is incorrect because not all changes require 30-day amendments - specifically, AUM changes (event 2) and custodian changes (event 4) can typically wait for the annual update. The key principle: Form ADV requires prompt amendments (within 30 days) for changes that affect: ownership, control, key personnel (IARs), disciplinary events, address/location, and other items specifically identified in the instructions as requiring prompt updates. Operational changes (like AUM fluctuations, custodian relationships) can typically wait for annual updates unless they fundamentally change the adviser's operations or registration status.

## Question 16
Coastal Investment Partners is a federally registered investment adviser with $280 million in AUM. The firm's Form ADV Part 2A contains a section titled "Item 5 - Fees and Compensation" which states: "We charge an annual asset-based fee according to the following schedule: 1.00% on the first $2 million, 0.75% on amounts from $2 million to $5 million, and 0.60% on amounts exceeding $5 million. Fees are calculated quarterly based on the market value of assets on the last business day of the preceding quarter and are deducted directly from client accounts in advance. Clients may terminate the advisory relationship at any time, and any prepaid unearned fees will be refunded on a pro-rata basis." A new client, Barbara, engages Coastal in April 2025 with $3.5 million in assets. Based on the disclosed fee schedule, her fee should be calculated as 1.00% on $2 million ($20,000) plus 0.75% on $1.5 million ($11,250), totaling $31,250 annually, or $7,812.50 per quarter. However, when Barbara receives her first quarterly statement from the custodian in July 2025, she notices that Coastal deducted $10,000 in fees for the quarter (April-June). When she questions this, Coastal's billing administrator explains that they actually charge a flat 1.00% annually on all assets for new clients during the first year of the relationship, transitioning to the tiered schedule in year two. Barbara was never informed of this "first year" pricing before engaging Coastal, and it does not appear anywhere in Form ADV Part 2A or in her investment advisory agreement (which references the fee schedule in Form ADV). Barbara is upset and files a complaint with the SEC. What violations has Coastal committed, and what remedies should be provided to Barbara?

A. Coastal violated Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act (anti-fraud provisions) by charging fees that differ materially from what was disclosed in Form ADV without client knowledge or consent; Barbara is entitled to a refund of the overcharge and Coastal must immediately correct Form ADV to accurately describe its actual fee practices
B. Coastal has committed a clerical billing error but no securities violation; the firm should apologize to Barbara, refund the overcharge, and implement better billing procedures
C. Coastal has not violated securities laws because fee schedules in Form ADV are merely guidelines and advisers have discretion to charge different fees based on client circumstances; Barbara agreed to the advisory relationship and is bound by whatever fees Coastal chooses to charge
D. Coastal violated its contract with Barbara but not securities laws; Barbara's remedy is to sue for breach of contract in civil court but the SEC has no jurisdiction over fee disputes

**Correct Answer:** A. Coastal violated Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act (anti-fraud provisions) by charging fees that differ materially from what was disclosed in Form ADV without client knowledge or consent; Barbara is entitled to a refund of the overcharge and Coastal must immediately correct Form ADV to accurately describe its actual fee practices

**Explanation:** Coastal has committed serious violations of the Investment Advisers Act's anti-fraud provisions. Analysis: Form ADV Part 2A is a regulatory disclosure document that must accurately describe the adviser's fee structure. When Coastal tells prospective clients and regulators in Form ADV that it charges according to a specific tiered schedule, but actually charges a flat 1.00% rate for all new clients in year one, this is a material misrepresentation. The fraud occurs in multiple ways: (1) Form ADV misrepresentation: Form ADV Part 2A stated fees are calculated according to the tiered schedule (1.00%, 0.75%, 0.60%). This disclosure is false because the firm actually charges 1.00% flat for year one. Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-1 prohibit fraudulent or deceptive acts, which includes materially false or misleading disclosures in Form ADV. (2) Client-level fraud: Barbara was never informed that she would be charged a flat 1.00% during year one despite Form ADV (which she presumably received and reviewed) stating she would be charged according to the tiered schedule. This is a material omission - the firm failed to disclose that its actual fee practices differ from Form ADV. (3) Contract violation: The investment advisory agreement reportedly references the fee schedule in Form ADV. If Barbara's contract says fees will be calculated per Form ADV and the firm charges different fees, the firm has breached its contract in addition to violating securities laws. (4) Overcharge: Barbara should have been charged approximately $7,813 per quarter but was charged $10,000 - an overcharge of approximately $2,187 per quarter or $8,748 annually. This is not an immaterial amount. The violations are serious because they go to fundamental issues of honesty and full disclosure in the adviser-client relationship. Investment advisers are fiduciaries and must deal with clients honestly and in good faith. Misrepresenting fees violates core fiduciary duties. Coastal should: (1) Immediately refund the overcharge to Barbara (approximately $2,187 for the first quarter, and ongoing); (2) Review all other client accounts to identify whether other clients have been overcharged relative to Form ADV disclosures, and refund them as well; (3) Immediately amend Form ADV Part 2A to accurately describe the firm's actual fee practices - either by disclosing the "first year flat rate" policy or by eliminating that policy and charging all clients according to the disclosed tiered schedule; (4) Provide updated brochures to all clients; (5) Consider retaining outside counsel to evaluate whether voluntary self-reporting to the SEC is appropriate given the seriousness of the violations; (6) Implement compliance procedures to ensure billing matches Form ADV disclosures. Additionally, the SEC could bring an enforcement action against Coastal for violations of Section 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-1, potentially resulting in fines, censure, or other sanctions. Option B is incorrect because this is not merely a "clerical error" - it's a systematic practice of charging fees that differ from Form ADV disclosures. A clerical error might be a one-time incorrect calculation; a policy of charging all first-year clients a flat rate contrary to Form ADV is a compliance failure and securities violation. Option C is dangerously incorrect. Fee schedules in Form ADV are not "merely guidelines" - they are regulatory disclosures that must accurately describe the adviser's practices. Advisers cannot charge whatever fees they want regardless of Form ADV - they must charge fees consistent with their disclosures or update their disclosures to match their practices. While advisers can negotiate fees and charge different fees to different clients (if properly disclosed), they cannot misrepresent their fee structure in Form ADV. Option D is incorrect because the SEC absolutely has jurisdiction over adviser fee practices through the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act. While Barbara could also sue for breach of contract in civil court, the SEC can and does bring enforcement actions for fee-related fraud and misrepresentation. The key principle: Investment advisers must ensure their actual practices match their Form ADV disclosures, particularly regarding fees. Any material discrepancy between disclosed fee structures and actual charges constitutes fraud under the Investment Advisers Act. If an adviser wants to charge fees differently than currently disclosed, it must first amend Form ADV, provide updated brochures to clients, and obtain client consent to any fee increases.

## Question 17
Riverside Advisory Group is a state-registered investment adviser in Illinois with $58 million in AUM. The firm is owned and operated by James Rodriguez, the sole IAR. James is considering various marketing initiatives to grow the firm and consults with a marketing advisor about the following proposed activities: (1) Creating a website that includes testimonials from three satisfied clients, with their written consent, describing how James helped them achieve their retirement goals; (2) Advertising that the firm provides "SEC-registered investment advisory services" to convey credibility and professionalism; (3) Offering to pay current clients $500 for each new client they successfully refer to the firm, with the referral fee paid after the new client has been with the firm for at least 3 months; (4) Publishing performance results showing that the firm's "typical client portfolio" returned 12.8% annually over the past 5 years, compared to the S&P 500's 10.2% return, with a disclaimer stating "past performance does not guarantee future results"; (5) Displaying James's professional credentials prominently on the website and business cards, including "MBA, CFP®, CFA®" after his name (James has an MBA from a reputable university, is a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional, but has only passed Level II of the CFA® exam and is not yet a CFA® charterholder). James's marketing advisor warns him that several of these proposed activities may violate the SEC's Marketing Rule or other regulations. Which activities are prohibited or problematic, and what corrections are needed?

A. Activities (1), (2), (3), and (5) all violate SEC or state regulations and should not be implemented as proposed; activity (4) may be permissible if proper disclosures are included
B. Only activities (2) and (5) are problematic; the others comply with current marketing rules for investment advisers
C. All five activities violate the SEC's Marketing Rule and are prohibited; James should not implement any of these marketing initiatives
D. Activities (1) and (3) violate the Marketing Rule's prohibition on testimonials and solicitor payments; the other activities are permissible

**Correct Answer:** A. Activities (1), (2), (3), and (5) all violate SEC or state regulations and should not be implemented as proposed; activity (4) may be permissible if proper disclosures are included

**Explanation:** Let's analyze each proposed marketing activity under the SEC's Marketing Rule (Rule 206(4)-1, as amended in 2020) and other regulations: (1) Client testimonials on website: The SEC's Marketing Rule, effective November 2021, permits testimonials and endorsements by clients IF specific conditions are met, including: disclosure of material conflicts, disclosure if the testimonial provider was compensated, and compliance with oversight and disqualification provisions. However, state regulators may have different rules. Many states still prohibit or heavily restrict testimonials. Since Riverside is a state-registered adviser, James must comply with Illinois state regulations, which may prohibit testimonials entirely or impose conditions beyond federal rules. James should check Illinois securities regulations before using testimonials. Additionally, even if testimonials are permitted, they must meet strict disclosure requirements about conflicts and compensation. This activity is potentially problematic depending on state rules. (2) Advertising "SEC-registered investment advisory services": This is PROHIBITED. State-registered investment advisers are NOT registered with the SEC - they're registered with state securities regulators. Claiming to provide "SEC-registered" services is false and misleading. Even for federally registered advisers, the SEC prohibits language that implies SEC approval or endorsement. The proper language would be "Registered investment adviser" or "State-registered investment adviser" or "Registered with the Illinois Securities Department." Using "SEC-registered" when the firm is state-registered is a material misrepresentation. This must be corrected. (3) Paying current clients $500 referral fees: This implicates the solicitor rules. Under SEC Rule 206(4)-3 (the cash solicitation rule) and equivalent state rules, paying compensation for client referrals requires: a written agreement with the solicitor, written disclosure to the client about the arrangement and compensation, and client acknowledgment. Additionally, the solicitor cannot have certain disqualifying events. While these requirements can be met, implementing a referral fee program requires careful compliance with solicitor rules. James cannot simply start paying clients $500 without proper agreements, disclosures, and client acknowledgments. Additionally, some states impose stricter requirements on solicitor arrangements. This activity requires significant compliance work and cannot be implemented as casually proposed. (4) Publishing performance showing "typical client" returned 12.8% vs. S&P 500's 10.2%: The Marketing Rule permits performance advertising IF it meets detailed requirements including: fair and balanced presentation, providing information about all portfolios (not cherry-picking), including gross and net-of-fee returns, providing comparison to relevant benchmark, and various disclosures. The concept of a "typical client portfolio" is problematic - how is "typical" defined? If James is cherry-picking his best-performing accounts or creating a hypothetical "typical" portfolio that doesn't represent actual client experiences, this could be misleading. To comply, James would need to: (a) define the specific portfolio or composite being presented (not vague "typical client"), (b) show both gross and net returns, (c) provide appropriate benchmark comparison (S&P 500 may or may not be appropriate depending on actual portfolio composition), (d) include required disclosures about performance calculation methodology and limitations. This activity might be permissible with significant additional disclosure and careful construction of performance presentations, but as casually proposed ("typical client"), it's likely misleading. (5) Using "CFA®" designation when only Level II passed: This is a SERIOUS VIOLATION of CFA Institute standards and potentially securities fraud. The CFA® designation can only be used by individuals who have: passed all three CFA exam levels, have qualifying work experience, and are members in good standing of CFA Institute. Using "CFA®" after your name when you have not completed the charter is explicitly prohibited by CFA Institute and constitutes false representation of credentials, which violates both FINRA/NASAA rules on professional designations and SEC anti-fraud provisions. James may use "CFA® Level II Candidate" or similar accurate description, but NOT "CFA®" as if he holds the charter. This must be corrected immediately - using a professional designation you haven't earned is fraud. Option B is incorrect because it misses problems with (1), (3), and (4). Option C is too extreme - not all activities are flatly prohibited; some need corrections/compliance work. Option D is incorrect because it misses the "SEC-registered" misrepresentation (item 2) and the false CFA designation (item 5), both of which are serious violations. The key principles: Investment adviser marketing is heavily regulated. The SEC's modernized Marketing Rule (effective 2021) relaxed some restrictions (permitting testimonials and certain performance advertising under conditions) but imposed detailed requirements. State-registered advisers must also comply with state rules, which may be more restrictive. False or misleading statements (like claiming SEC registration when state-registered, or using professional designations not earned) are always prohibited under anti-fraud rules. Any marketing materials must be fair, balanced, and not misleading, with appropriate disclosures.

## Question 18
Summit Financial Advisory, LLC is a state-registered investment adviser in Colorado with $64 million in AUM. The firm has 8 investment adviser representatives and serves approximately 140 clients. The firm's CCO, Patricia, is conducting the firm's annual compliance review and discovers several issues with the firm's Form ADV disclosures regarding its custody practices. Currently, Form ADV Part 1A Item 9 indicates that the firm does NOT have custody of client funds or securities, and Part 2A states: "We do not have custody of your assets. All client funds and securities are held with qualified custodians, and you will receive account statements directly from your custodian. We urge you to carefully review these statements." However, Patricia's review reveals: (1) The firm has written authorization from all clients to deduct advisory fees quarterly directly from client accounts at the custodian; (2) One of the firm's principals, Michael, serves as executor for the estate of a deceased client whose account ($1.2 million) is still being managed by the firm during estate settlement; (3) Another principal, Sarah, serves as trustee for three client family trusts (totaling $4.5 million) and has full legal authority over the trust assets; (4) The firm has standing letters of authorization from 22 clients allowing the firm to direct the custodian to transfer funds from client accounts to pay third parties such as mortgages, charitable contributions, and distributions to family members; (5) The firm uses a third-party check-forwarding service where some clients mail checks (investment contributions) to the firm's office, and the firm forwards them to the custodian for deposit - checks are typically in the firm's possession for 1-3 business days before being forwarded. Patricia realizes the firm likely has custody based on some or all of these situations, despite the Form ADV disclosure stating otherwise. What are the firm's immediate obligations, and what specific Custody Rule compliance steps must be implemented?

A. The firm must immediately amend Form ADV to disclose custody, engage an independent public accountant to conduct a surprise examination of client accounts, ensure clients receive quarterly statements from custodians, and file Form ADV-E annually
B. The firm has custody for situations (2), (3), and (5) only; it should amend Form ADV accordingly but does not need a surprise examination because the custody is limited to a few specific situations
C. The firm must terminate all arrangements that create custody (situations 1-5) and then amend Form ADV to confirm it has no custody, as advisers cannot maintain custody of client assets without special registration
D. The firm has inadvertent custody through these situations but can correct it by implementing better procedures; no Form ADV amendment or surprise examination is required if the firm ensures clients receive custodian statements

**Correct Answer:** A. The firm must immediately amend Form ADV to disclose custody, engage an independent public accountant to conduct a surprise examination of client accounts, ensure clients receive quarterly statements from custodians, and file Form ADV-E annually

**Explanation:** Summit Financial Advisory has custody of client assets based on multiple situations, making its current Form ADV disclosure false and creating serious Custody Rule compliance obligations. Let's analyze each situation: (1) Direct fee deduction with written authorization: Having written authorization to deduct advisory fees directly from client accounts is a form of custody under Rule 206(4)-2. However, there's an exception: if the adviser has written client authorization, the qualified custodian sends account statements directly to clients at least quarterly, and the adviser has a reasonable basis to believe clients are receiving statements, the surprise examination requirement does not apply to these accounts. So situation (1) creates custody but may qualify for a surprise examination exception. (2) Serving as executor of deceased client's estate: When firm personnel serve as executor/personal representative for a client estate and the estate assets are managed by the firm, the firm has custody. This is because the executor has legal authority over the assets. This absolutely creates custody requiring full Custody Rule compliance, including surprise examination (unless the estate is subject to annual audit, which is uncommon for smaller estates). (3) Serving as trustee: When firm personnel serve as trustees for client trusts, the firm has custody because the trustee has legal authority over trust assets. This is one of the most common ways advisers inadvertently obtain custody. This creates custody requiring full Custody Rule compliance. However, there's an exception: if the trustee is subject to regular examination by a federal or state regulatory authority or an independent public accountant, surprise examination may not be required. For most family trusts, this exception doesn't apply, so full surprise examination is required. (4) Standing Letters of Authorization (SLOAs): Traditionally, having authority to direct custodians to transfer client funds to third parties was considered custody. However, the SEC issued a no-action letter (February 2017) providing seven conditions under which SLOAs don't constitute custody: the client provides written authorization, the transfer must be to a third party previously authorized by the client, transfers must be of a specified amount or according to a specified formula, the client must provide authorization to the custodian, the custodian must verify the client's instruction, the custodian must send confirmation directly to the client, and the client can terminate the authorization. If Summit's SLOAs meet ALL seven conditions, they may not constitute custody. If any condition is not met, they DO constitute custody. Patricia should review the SLOA arrangements against these seven conditions. (5) Check forwarding: When clients send checks to the adviser's office and the adviser holds them for 1-3 days before forwarding to the custodian, the adviser has temporary possession of client funds, which is custody. The Custody Rule defines custody as having possession or authority. Even brief possession (1-3 days) is possession. There's no exception for "we're just forwarding them." This creates custody requiring full Custody Rule compliance.
