# Series 65: Detailed Explanations Part 2 (Questions 126-250)

## Taxation Continued (Questions 126-150)

### 126. Penalty for Excess IRA Contributions
**Question:** The penalty for excess IRA contributions is:
- A) 1%
- B) 6%
- C) 10%
- D) 50%

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Excess contributions to IRAs are subject to a 6% excise tax per year until corrected. The penalty applies each year the excess remains in the account. To avoid the penalty, excess contributions must be withdrawn by the tax filing deadline (including extensions) for the year the contribution was made.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) 1%:** This is not an IRA penalty rate.
- **C) 10%:** This is the early withdrawal penalty, not excess contribution penalty.
- **D) 50%:** This is the penalty for failing to take required minimum distributions.

**Key Concept:** Excess IRA contributions = 6% penalty per year until corrected.

### 127. Age Limit for 10% Early Withdrawal Penalty
**Question:** The 10% early withdrawal penalty applies until age:
- A) 55
- B) 59½
- C) 62
- D) 65

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
The 10% additional tax (early withdrawal penalty) applies to distributions from qualified retirement plans and IRAs before age 59½, unless an exception applies. Common exceptions include disability, death, substantially equal periodic payments, first-time home purchase, and higher education expenses.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) 55:** This is an exception for qualified public safety employees, not the general rule.
- **C) 62:** This is the earliest Social Security retirement age, not related to early withdrawal penalties.
- **D) 65:** This is a common retirement age but not the penalty threshold.

**Key Concept:** Early withdrawal penalty applies before age 59½ unless exception applies.

### 128. RMD Divisor at Age 72
**Question:** The RMD divisor at age 72 is approximately:
- A) 15.0
- B) 20.0
- C) 25.6
- D) 27.4

**Answer: D**
**Detailed Explanation:**
For age 72, the Uniform Lifetime Table divisor is 27.4. This divisor is used to calculate required minimum distributions (RMDs) from retirement accounts. The RMD is calculated as: Account balance on December 31 of prior year ÷ Life expectancy factor (divisor).

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) 15.0:** This is close to the divisor for age 85 (15.5).
- **B) 20.0:** This is close to the divisor for age 77 (22.9).
- **C) 25.6:** This is close to the divisor for age 73 (26.5).

**Key Concept:** RMD divisor for age 72 = 27.4 (using Uniform Lifetime Table).

### 129. Maximum Saver's Credit
**Question:** The maximum Saver's Credit is:
- A) $500
- B) $1,000
- C) $2,000
- D) $4,000

**Answer: C**
**Detailed Explanation:**
The Retirement Savings Contributions Credit (Saver's Credit) provides a credit of up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for married filing jointly. The credit rate is 50%, 20%, or 10% of contributions, depending on AGI. To qualify, taxpayers must be at least 18, not a full-time student, and not claimed as a dependent.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) $500:** This would be the maximum for a 50% credit on $1,000 contribution for a single filer.
- **B) $1,000:** This is the single filer maximum, not the overall maximum.
- **D) $4,000:** Too high; not a current Saver's Credit amount.

**Key Concept:** Saver's Credit max = $1,000 single / $2,000 MFJ (based on 50% of $2,000/$4,000 contributions).

---

### 130. Standard Deduction for Married Filing Jointly
**Question:** The standard deduction for married filing jointly is:
- A) $12,400
- B) $18,800
- C) $24,800
- D) $25,100

**Answer: D**
**Detailed Explanation:**
For 2021, the standard deduction amounts are: $25,100 for married filing jointly, $18,800 for heads of household, and $12,550 for singles and married filing separately. These amounts are adjusted annually for inflation.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) $12,400:** This was the 2020 amount for singles.
- **B) $18,800:** This is the 2021 head of household amount.
- **C) $24,800:** This was the 2020 MFJ amount.

**Key Concept:** 2021 standard deduction: $25,100 MFJ; $18,800 HOH; $12,550 single/MFS.

---

### 131. SALT Deduction Limit
**Question:** The SALT deduction limit is:
- A) $5,000
- B) $10,000
- C) $15,000
- D) Unlimited

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 limited the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $10,000 ($5,000 for married filing separately). This includes the total of state and local income taxes, sales taxes, and property taxes. The limit applies to both itemizers and those taking the standard deduction.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) $5,000:** This is the MFS limit, not the general limit.
- **C) $15,000:** Not a current SALT limit.
- **D) Unlimited:** SALT deductions were unlimited before 2018 but are now capped.

**Key Concept:** SALT deduction capped at $10,000 ($5,000 MFS) from 2018-2025.

### 132. Mortgage Interest Deduction Limit
**Question:** The mortgage interest deduction limit is:
- A) $500,000
- B) $750,000
- C) $1,000,000
- D) Unlimited

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
For mortgages taken out after December 15, 2017, the mortgage interest deduction is limited to interest on up to $750,000 of acquisition debt ($375,000 for MFS). For older mortgages, the limit is $1,000,000. Home equity interest is only deductible if used to buy, build, or improve the home.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) $500,000:** Too low; this was never the limit.
- **C) $1,000,000:** This is the limit for pre-2018 mortgages.
- **D) Unlimited:** Mortgage interest has never been fully unlimited.

**Key Concept:** Post-2017 mortgages: $750,000 limit; pre-2018: $1,000,000 limit.

---

### 133. Child Tax Credit for 2021
**Question:** The child tax credit for 2021 is:
- A) $1,000
- B) $2,000
- C) $3,000
- D) $3,600

**Answer: D**
**Detailed Explanation:**
For 2021, the child tax credit was temporarily increased to $3,600 for children under 6 and $3,000 for children ages 6-17. The credit is fully refundable, and advance payments were made monthly. This was part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) $1,000:** This was the amount from 2003-2017.
- **B) $2,000:** This is the permanent amount under the TCJA.
- **C) $3,000:** This is the 2021 amount for children 6-17, not the maximum.

**Key Concept:** 2021 temporary increases: $3,600 (<6); $3,000 (6-17); normally $2,000.

---

### 134. Net Unrealized Appreciation Rules
**Question:** The net unrealized appreciation rules apply to:
- A) IRA distributions
- B) Employer stock in qualified plans
- C) Annuity contracts
- D) All retirement distributions

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA) rules apply specifically to employer securities (company stock) distributed from qualified retirement plans. When taking a lump-sum distribution, the cost basis is taxed as ordinary income, but the NUA (gain) is taxed at long-term capital gains rates when the stock is sold.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) IRA distributions:** NUA doesn't apply to IRAs.
- **C) Annuity contracts:** NUA applies to securities, not annuities.
- **D) All retirement distributions:** Only applies to employer securities.

**Key Concept:** NUA = special tax treatment for employer stock in qualified plans.

---

### 135. Throwback Rule Application
**Question:** The throwback rule applies to:
- A) Trust distributions
- B) IRA contributions
- C) Capital gains
- D) Foreign income

**Answer: A**
**Detailed Explanation:**
The throwback rule applies to complex trusts that accumulate income rather than distributing it currently. If such a trust later makes a distribution of accumulated income, the throwback rule may apply to calculate the tax due, preventing beneficiaries from deferring tax indefinitely.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **B) IRA contributions:** No throwback rule applies.
- **C) Capital gains:** Not specifically related to throwback rules.
- **D) Foreign income:** Different rules apply (e.g., foreign tax credit).

**Key Concept:** Throwback rules prevent tax deferral through trust accumulation distributions.

---

### 136. Kiddie Tax Rate Structure
**Question:** The kiddie tax uses:
- A) Parent's tax rate
- B) Trust tax rates
- C) Child's tax rate
- D) Flat 10% rate

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Under current law (since 2018), the kiddie tax calculates a child's tax using the estate and trust tax rates rather than the parent's marginal rate. This change was made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and generally results in higher taxes on children's unearned income.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) Parent's tax rate:** This was the method from 1986-2017 but no longer applies.
- **C) Child's tax rate:** The child's rate would typically be lower; kiddie tax uses higher rates.
- **D) Flat 10% rate:** Not accurate; uses progressive trust rates.

**Key Concept:** Current kiddie tax uses trust tax rates (higher than old parent-rate method).

---

### 137. Taxation of Nonqualified Annuity Earnings
**Question:** The tax on nonqualified annuity earnings is:
- A) Ordinary income
- B) Capital gains
- C) Tax-free
- D) Deferred indefinitely

**Answer: A**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Earnings in nonqualified annuities grow tax-deferred. When distributed, the earnings portion is taxed as ordinary income (last-in, first-out treatment). The principal (cost basis) is recovered tax-free. This differs from qualified annuities in retirement accounts, where all distributions are ordinary income.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **B) Capital gains:** Annuity earnings don't qualify for capital gains treatment.
- **C) Tax-free:** Only the return of principal is tax-free; earnings are taxable.
- **D) Deferred indefinitely:** Tax is deferred until distribution but not eliminated.

**Key Concept:** Nonqualified annuity: basis tax-free, earnings ordinary income.

---

### 138. Estate Tax Portability
**Question:** The estate tax portability allows:
- A) Transfer of unused exclusion to spouse
- B) Transfer of assets tax-free
- C) Both A and B
- D) Neither A nor B

**Answer: A**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Portability allows a surviving spouse to use any unused portion of the deceased spouse's estate tax exemption. To elect portability, the executor must file Form 706 even if no estate tax is due. This effectively doubles the exemption for married couples to $23.4 million (2021).

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **B) Transfer of assets tax-free:** Assets still transfer but may be subject to tax; portability is about exemption amounts.
- **C) Both A and B:** Incorrect because B is not accurate.
- **D) Neither A nor B:** Incorrect because A is accurate.

**Key Concept:** Portability = unused exemption transfers to surviving spouse.

---

### 139. Gift-Splitting Election
**Question:** The gift-splitting election allows:
- A) Both spouses to use annual exclusion
- B) Double the annual exclusion
- C) Both A and B
- D) Neither A nor B

**Answer: C**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Gift-splitting allows married couples to treat gifts made by one spouse as made equally by both spouses. This effectively doubles the annual exclusion to $30,000 (2021) per recipient without using lifetime exemption. Both spouses must consent to split gifts, and both must file gift tax returns if over the annual exclusion.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) Both spouses to use annual exclusion:** True but incomplete; also doubles the amount.
- **B) Double the annual exclusion:** True but incomplete; requires both spouses' participation.
- **D) Neither A nor B:** Incorrect because both are benefits of gift-splitting.

**Key Concept:** Gift-splitting = $30,000 per recipient ($15,000 × 2 spouses).

---

### 140. Trust Accounting Income
**Question:** The trust accounting income includes:
- A) Capital gains
- B) Ordinary income
- C) Both A and B
- D) Neither A nor B

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Trust accounting income generally includes ordinary income (interest, dividends, rents) but excludes capital gains, which are typically allocated to principal. This distinction is important for determining distributions to income beneficiaries versus remainder beneficiaries.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) Capital gains:** These are generally allocated to principal, not income.
- **C) Both A and B:** Incorrect because capital gains are excluded.
- **D) Neither A nor B:** Incorrect because ordinary income is included.

**Key Concept:** Trust accounting income = ordinary income; capital gains = principal.

---

### 141. Depreciation Recapture Taxation
**Question:** The depreciation recapture is taxed as:
- A) Ordinary income
- B) Capital gain
- C) Both
- D) Neither

**Answer: C**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Depreciation recapture can be taxed as both ordinary income and capital gain. Section 1245 property recaptures depreciation as ordinary income up to the lesser of gain or depreciation taken. Section 1250 property (real estate) has partial recapture at 25% rate, with any remaining gain at capital gains rates.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) Ordinary income:** Only part is ordinary; some may be capital gain.
- **B) Capital gain:** Only part is capital gain; some is ordinary income.
- **D) Neither:** Incorrect; it is taxed.

**Key Concept:** Depreciation recapture = part ordinary (25% for real estate), part capital gain.

---

### 142. At-Risk Rules Application
**Question:** The at-risk rules apply to:
- A) All investments
- B) Passive activities
- C) Real estate only
- D) Business losses

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
The at-risk rules limit loss deductions to the amount the taxpayer has at risk in the activity. These rules primarily apply to passive activities, preventing taxpayers from deducting losses exceeding their economic investment. The rules are separate from but work with passive activity loss rules.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) All investments:** Only applies to certain activities, not all investments.
- **C) Real estate only:** Applies to various passive activities, not just real estate.
- **D) Business losses:** Only applies to passive business losses, not active business losses.

**Key Concept:** At-risk rules limit passive loss deductions to amount invested/at risk.

---

### 143. Passive Activity Loss Limitation
**Question:** The passive activity loss limitation applies until:
- A) The activity is sold
- B) The taxpayer actively participates
- C) Both A and B
- D) Neither A nor B

**Answer: A**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Passive activity losses (PAL) are suspended and carried forward until: (1) the activity generates passive income, (2) the taxpayer disposes of the entire interest in a taxable transaction, or (3) the taxpayer's status changes (e.g., death). Active participation doesn't automatically remove PAL limitations.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **B) The taxpayer actively participates:** Active participation in rental real estate allows up to $25,000 loss deduction but doesn't eliminate PAL rules.
- **C) Both A and B:** Incorrect because B alone doesn't eliminate limitations.
- **D) Neither A nor B:** Incorrect because A is correct.

**Key Concept:** PAL suspended until activity sold or generates passive income.

---

### 144. Home Office Deduction Requirements
**Question:** The home office deduction requires:
- A) Exclusive use
- B) Regular use
- C) Principal place of business
- D) All of the above

**Answer: D**
**Detailed Explanation:**
To qualify for a home office deduction, the space must be: (1) used exclusively for business, (2) used regularly for business, and (3) the principal place of business or a place to meet clients. Alternatively, it can be a separate structure not attached to the home used for business.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A, B, C individually:** Each is necessary but not sufficient alone; all three are required.
- **Any combination missing one:** Incomplete; all requirements must be met.

**Key Concept:** Home office deduction requires exclusive, regular, and principal use.

---

### 145. HSA Triple Tax Advantage
**Question:** The health savings account triple tax advantage means:
- A) Deductible, tax-free growth, tax-free withdrawals
- B) Tax credit, deduction, exclusion
- C) All of the above
- D) None of the above

**Answer: A**
**Detailed Explanation:**
HSAs offer three tax benefits: (1) Contributions are tax-deductible (or pre-tax), (2) Earnings grow tax-free, and (3) Withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax-free. This makes HSAs the only account with triple tax advantage.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **B) Tax credit, deduction, exclusion:** HSAs don't offer credits for contributions.
- **C) All of the above:** Incorrect because B is not accurate.
- **D) None of the above:** Incorrect because A is accurate.

**Key Concept:** HSA = deductible contributions, tax-free growth, tax-free qualified withdrawals.

---

### 146. Coverdell ESA Contribution Limit
**Question:** The Coverdell ESA contribution limit is:
- A) $1,000
- B) $2,000
- C) $5,000
- D) $10,000

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Coverdell Education Savings Accounts have an annual contribution limit of $2,000 per beneficiary. Contributions are not deductible, but earnings grow tax-free and withdrawals for qualified education expenses are tax-free. Income phase-outs apply to contributors.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) $1,000:** Too low; limit has been $2,000 since 2002.
- **C) $5,000:** This is approximately the annual 529 plan contribution limit in some states.
- **D) $10,000:** Too high; not a Coverdell limit.

**Key Concept:** Coverdell ESA limit = $2,000 per beneficiary annually.

---

### 147. 529 Plan Qualified Expenses
**Question:** The 529 plan qualified expenses include:
- A) K-12 tuition
- B) College room and board
- C) Both A and B

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) K-12 tuition:** True but incomplete; college expenses also qualify.
- **B) College room and board:** True but incomplete; K-12 also qualifies.
- **D) Neither A nor B:** Incorrect because both qualify.

**Key Concept:** 529 plans cover K-12 tuition, college expenses, room/board, technology.

---

### 148. ABLE Account Similarity
**Question:** The ABLE account contribution limit is similar to:
- A) IRA
- B) 529 plan
- C) Coverdell ESA
- D) HSA

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
ABLE (Achieving a Better Life Experience) accounts are modeled after 529 plans. Both offer tax-advantaged savings for specific purposes (disability expenses for ABLE, education for 529). Annual contribution limits are similar, and both have aggregate limits around $300,000+.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) IRA:** Different purpose, structure, and limits.
- **C) Coverdell ESA:** Different limits ($2,000 vs. ABLE's ~$15,000).
- **D) HSA:** Different purpose (medical) and contribution limits.

**Key Concept:** ABLE accounts are based on 529 plan structure.

---

### 149. Trust Distributable Net Income
**Question:** The trust distributable net income includes:
- A) Tax-exempt income
- B) Capital gains
- C) Both A and B
- D) Neither A nor B

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Distributable Net Income (DNI) is the maximum amount of distribution taxable to beneficiaries. It includes taxable income but excludes: (1) capital gains allocated to principal, (2) tax-exempt interest, and (3) other items allocated to principal by the trust document.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) Tax-exempt income:** Excluded from DNI.
- **C) Both A and B:** Incorrect because A is excluded.
- **D) Neither A nor B:** Incorrect because B can be included if not allocated to principal.

**Key Concept:** DNI = taxable income available for distribution (excludes tax-exempt, capital gains allocated to principal).

---

### 150. Charitable Remainder Trust Structure
**Question:** The charitable remainder trust provides:
- A) Income to charity, remainder to donor
- B) Income to donor, remainder to charity
- C) Income to both
- D) Neither

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
A Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT) provides income to non-charitable beneficiaries (donor or others) for a term of years or life, with the remainder passing to charity. This provides the donor with an income stream, charitable deduction, and eventual charity benefit.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) Income to charity, remainder to donor:** This describes a Charitable Lead Trust.
- **C) Income to both:** Not typically; income goes to non-charitable beneficiaries.
- **D) Neither:** Incorrect; specific structure exists.

**Key Concept:** CRT = income to donor (or others), remainder to charity.

## **Portfolio Management (Questions 151-180)**

### 151. Treynor Ratio Measurement
**Question:** The Treynor ratio measures:
- A) Return per unit of total risk
- B) Return per unit of systematic risk
- C) Risk-adjusted return
- D) All of the above

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
The Treynor ratio measures risk-adjusted return using systematic risk (beta). Formula: (Portfolio return - Risk-free rate) ÷ Beta. It evaluates how well a portfolio compensates for market risk, making it useful for diversified portfolios where unsystematic risk is minimized.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) Return per unit of total risk:** This describes the Sharpe ratio (uses standard deviation).
- **C) Risk-adjusted return:** Too vague; both Treynor and Sharpe measure this differently.
- **D) All of the above:** Incorrect because A describes Sharpe, not Treynor.

**Key Concept:** Treynor = (Return - Rf) ÷ Beta (systematic risk only).

---

### 152. Sharpe Ratio Risk Measure
**Question:** The Sharpe ratio uses:
- A) Alpha
- B) Beta
- C) Standard deviation
- D) Correlation

**Answer: C**
**Detailed Explanation:**
The Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted return using total risk (standard deviation). Formula: (Portfolio return - Risk-free rate) ÷ Standard deviation of portfolio returns. It evaluates return per unit of total volatility.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) Alpha:** Used in Jensen's alpha, not Sharpe.
- **B) Beta:** Used in Treynor ratio, not Sharpe.
- **D) Correlation:** Not directly used in Sharpe ratio calculation.

**Key Concept:** Sharpe = (Return - Rf) ÷ σ (total risk).

---

### 153. Jensen's Alpha Measurement
**Question:** Jensen's alpha measures:
- A) Excess return over CAPM
- B) Total risk
- C) Systematic risk
- D) Unsystematic risk

**Answer: A**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Jensen's alpha measures a portfolio's excess return over its expected CAPM return. Formula: Actual return - [Rf + Beta × (Market return - Rf)]. Positive alpha indicates outperformance after adjusting for market risk.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **B) Total risk:** Measured by standard deviation, not alpha.
- **C) Systematic risk:** Measured by beta, not alpha.
- **D) Unsystematic risk:** Not directly measured by alpha.

**Key Concept:** Jensen's alpha = Actual return - CAPM expected return.

---

### 154. Optimal Portfolio on Efficient Frontier
**Question:** The optimal portfolio on the efficient frontier is:
- A) Minimum variance portfolio
- B) Tangency portfolio
- C) Maximum return portfolio
- D) Equal-weighted portfolio

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
The tangency portfolio (optimal risky portfolio) is where the capital market line (CML) is tangent to the efficient frontier. This portfolio provides the highest Sharpe ratio and is combined with the risk-free asset to create optimal portfolios for different risk tolerances.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) Minimum variance portfolio:** Lowest risk but not necessarily optimal return/risk tradeoff.
- **C) Maximum return portfolio:** Highest risk; not optimal for risk-averse investors.
- **D) Equal-weighted portfolio:** Not necessarily on efficient frontier.

**Key Concept:** Tangency portfolio = optimal risky portfolio (max Sharpe ratio).

---

### 155. Immunization Matching Requirements
**Question:** Immunization matches:
- A) Duration of assets and liabilities
- B) Convexity of assets and liabilities
- C) Both A and B
- D) Neither A nor B

**Answer: C**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Complete immunization requires matching: (1) Duration (price sensitivity to interest rates), (2) Convexity (curvature of price-yield relationship), and (3) Present value of assets and liabilities. This protects against parallel interest rate changes.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) Duration only:** Partial immunization; convexity mismatch causes risk.
- **B) Convexity only:** Not sufficient without duration matching.
- **D) Neither:** Incorrect; both are required for full immunization.

**Key Concept:** Immunization requires duration AND convexity matching.
