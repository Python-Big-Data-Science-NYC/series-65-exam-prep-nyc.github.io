# Series 65: Detailed Explanations Part 1 (Questions 1-125)

## Registration & Compliance (Questions 1-30)

### 1. RIA Registration Requirements ($25-100M AUM)
**Question:** If an RIA has between $25 million and $100 million in AUM, where must it register?
- A) SEC only
- B) State(s) only
- C) Either SEC or state(s), at the adviser's discretion
- D) Both SEC and state(s)

**Answer: C**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act (NSMIA), investment advisers with assets under management (AUM) between $25 million and $100 million are considered "mid-sized advisers" and have the option to choose whether to register with the SEC or with state securities authorities. This flexibility allows advisers to select the most appropriate regulatory framework for their business model.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) SEC only:** Incorrect because advisers with less than $100 million AUM are generally required to register at the state level, though mid-sized advisers have the option.
- **B) State(s) only:** Incorrect because while state registration is required for small advisers (<$25M AUM), mid-sized advisers have a choice.
- **D) Both SEC and state(s):** Incorrect because dual registration isn't required for mid-sized advisers; they must choose one regulatory authority.

**Key Concept:** NSMIA created three tiers: <$25M AUM = state registration; $25M-$100M AUM = adviser's choice; >$100M AUM = SEC registration (with some exceptions).

### 2. Purpose of Form ADV Part 2A
**Question:** What is the primary purpose of Form ADV Part 2A?
- A) To register with FINRA
- B) To provide clients with a brochure detailing services, fees, and conflicts
- C) To file annual financial statements
- D) To report custody of client assets

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Form ADV Part 2A is known as the "brochure" that investment advisers must deliver to clients and prospective clients. It provides essential information about the adviser's business practices, fees, conflicts of interest, disciplinary history, and educational background of key personnel. This disclosure document helps clients make informed decisions about whether to engage the adviser's services.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) To register with FINRA:** Incorrect. Form ADV is for SEC/state registration, not FINRA. Broker-dealers use Form BD for FINRA registration.
- **C) To file annual financial statements:** Incorrect. Financial statements may be required elsewhere but aren't the primary purpose of Part 2A.
- **D) To report custody of client assets:** Incorrect. Custody arrangements are disclosed in Part 2A but this isn't the primary purpose.

**Key Concept:** The "brochure rule" (Rule 204-3) requires delivery of Form ADV Part 2A to help clients evaluate the adviser.

### 3. State Securities Registration Methods (Uniform Securities Act)
**Question:** Under the Uniform Securities Act, which is NOT a method of state securities registration?
- A) Registration by coordination
- B) Registration by notification
- C) Registration by qualification
- D) Registration by exemption

**Answer: D**
**Detailed Explanation:**
The Uniform Securities Act recognizes three primary methods of securities registration at the state level:
1. **Registration by Coordination:** For securities simultaneously being registered with the SEC under the 1933 Act.
2. **Registration by Notification:** For established issuers meeting specific financial and operational criteria.
3. **Registration by Qualification:** For securities that don't qualify for coordination or notification, requiring full disclosure.

"Registration by exemption" is not a registration method but rather refers to securities or transactions that are exempt from registration requirements entirely.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A, B, C:** All are valid registration methods under the USA. Each applies to different situations based on the issuer's characteristics and the security type.

**Key Concept:** Exemptions relieve issuers from registration requirements; they are not themselves a method of registration.

---

### 4. Terminating Registration When Moving Firms
**Question:** An IAR moves from one RIA firm to another. Which form must be filed to terminate registration at the old firm?
- A) Form U4
- B) Form U5
- C) Form ADV-W
- D) Form BR

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Form U5 (Uniform Termination Notice for Securities Industry Registration) is filed by a firm to terminate an individual's registration with that firm. When an Investment Adviser Representative (IAR) leaves a firm, the firm must file Form U5 to update the individual's registration status in the CRD system.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) Form U4:** This is used to INITIATE or update registration, not terminate it.
- **C) Form ADV-W:** Used by investment advisers to withdraw from SEC or state registration, not for individual representatives.
- **D) Form BR:** Used by broker-dealers to register branch offices, not for individual terminations.

**Key Concept:** U4 = registration/update; U5 = termination; filed by the firm, not the individual.

---

### 5. Brochure Rule Delivery Timing
**Question:** The "brochure rule" requires delivery of Form ADV Part 2A to a prospective client at least how many hours before entering into an advisory contract?
- A) 24 hours
- B) 48 hours
- C) 72 hours
- D) 96 hours

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Rule 204-3 under the Investment Advisers Act requires delivery of the brochure (Form ADV Part 2A) at least 48 hours before entering into an advisory contract. Alternatively, it may be delivered at the time of contract signing if the client has the right to terminate the contract within five business days without penalty.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) 24 hours:** Too short; doesn't give clients adequate review time.
- **C) 72 hours and D) 96 hours:** Longer than required; the rule specifically mandates 48 hours.

**Key Concept:** 48-hour rule ensures clients have time to review important disclosures before committing.

### 6. Activities Not Requiring IA Registration
**Question:** Which activity would NOT require registration as an investment adviser?
- A) Providing personalized investment advice for a fee
- B) Publishing a newsletter with generic market commentary
- C) Managing portfolios for 15 clients with discretion
- D) Advising a pension plan for compensation

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Publishing impersonal investment advice (such as newsletters, books, or websites with general market commentary) typically does not require investment adviser registration. The key distinction is that such advice is not personalized to specific clients' circumstances.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) Providing personalized investment advice for a fee:** This meets the definition of investment advice requiring registration.
- **C) Managing portfolios for 15 clients with discretion:** This constitutes investment advisory services, regardless of the number of clients.
- **D) Advising a pension plan for compensation:** This requires registration unless an exemption applies.

**Key Concept:** The "impersonality exception" excludes publishers of general financial information from IA registration requirements.

### 7. Blue Sky Law Exemptions
**Question:** Under state "blue sky laws," which securities are typically exempt from registration?
- A) Municipal bonds
- B) Corporate bonds issued by out-of-state companies
- C) Mutual funds sold to state residents
- D) Securities issued by banks

**Answer: D**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Under most state blue sky laws, securities issued by banks (both national and state-chartered) are exempt from state registration requirements. This exemption recognizes the existing regulatory oversight by banking authorities.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) Municipal bonds:** These are typically exempt under the federal level (1933 Act), but some states may require registration.
- **B) Corporate bonds issued by out-of-state companies:** These generally require state registration or qualification.
- **C) Mutual funds sold to state residents:** These typically require state registration or notice filing.

**Key Concept:** Bank-issued securities enjoy broad exemptions due to existing banking regulation.

---

### 8. Custody Requirements for RIAs
**Question:** An RIA has custody of client assets. What additional requirement applies?
- A) Quarterly surprise audits
- B) Annual surprise audit by an independent CPA
- C) Daily reconciliation by the CCO
- D) Segregation of assets with a broker-dealer

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Rule 206(4)-2 under the Investment Advisers Act requires investment advisers with custody of client funds or securities to undergo an annual surprise examination by an independent certified public accountant. This audit verifies that client assets are properly safeguarded.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) Quarterly surprise audits:** Too frequent; the rule specifies annual examinations.
- **C) Daily reconciliation by the CCO:** While good practice, not specifically required by the custody rule.
- **D) Segregation of assets with a broker-dealer:** Required for certain custody arrangements but not the additional requirement specified.

**Key Concept:** Custody triggers additional safeguards, with the surprise audit being a key protection.

### 9. Non-Accredited Investors in Rule 506(b) Offerings
**Question:** What is the maximum number of non-accredited investors allowed in a Rule 506(b) private placement?
- A) 10
- B) 35
- C) 100
- D) Unlimited

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Rule 506(b) of Regulation D allows issuers to sell securities to an unlimited number of accredited investors but limits non-accredited investors to 35. Additionally, all non-accredited investors must be "sophisticated" or have a purchaser representative, and they must receive specific disclosure documents.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) 10:** This was an old limit under different rules; 506(b) allows 35.
- **C) 100:** This is not a Regulation D limit.
- **D) Unlimited:** Only accredited investors can be unlimited; non-accredited are limited.

**Key Concept:** 506(b): 35 non-accredited (must be sophisticated); unlimited accredited.

### 10. Performance-Based Advertising Rules
**Question:** Which SEC rule prohibits performance-based advertising unless certain conditions are met?
- A) Rule 206(4)-1
- B) Rule 10b-5
- C) Rule 144
- D) Rule 506

**Answer: A**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Rule 206(4)-1 under the Investment Advisers Act governs advertising by investment advisers. It places restrictions on performance-based advertising, requiring that such advertisements must not be false or misleading and must include specific disclosures, such as the effect of fees and taxes.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **B) Rule 10b-5:** This is the anti-fraud rule under the 1934 Act, not specifically about advertising.
- **C) Rule 144:** Governs resales of restricted securities, not advertising.
- **D) Rule 506:** Part of Regulation D for private placements, not advertising rules.

**Key Concept:** Rule 206(4)-1 is the primary advertising rule for investment advisers.

## **Taxation (Questions 111-125)**

### 111. Kiddie Tax Age Limit
**Question:** The kiddie tax applies to unearned income of children under age:
- A) 18
- B) 19
- C) 24
- D) 26

**Answer: C**
**Detailed Explanation:**
The kiddie tax applies to the unearned income of children who are: (1) under age 18, OR (2) age 18 with earned income less than half their support, OR (3) age 19-23 and full-time students with earned income less than half their support. Therefore, the maximum age is 24 (for a child who turns 24 during the year after being 23 and a student).

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) 18:** Too low; includes some older children.
- **B) 19:** Doesn't account for full-time students.
- **D) 26:** Too high; kiddie tax doesn't apply this long.

**Key Concept:** Kiddie tax reaches up to age 23 (24 at end of year) for dependent full-time students.

### 112. Gift Tax Annual Exclusion
**Question:** The gift tax annual exclusion is:
- A) $10,000
- B) $15,000
- C) $25,000
- D) $50,000

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
For 2021, the annual gift tax exclusion is $15,000 per recipient per year. This means an individual can give up to $15,000 to any number of recipients each year without using any of their lifetime gift tax exemption or filing a gift tax return.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) $10,000:** This was the amount from 2001-2002; it has increased with inflation.
- **C) $25,000 and D) $50,000:** These amounts are incorrect; the exclusion has never been this high.

**Key Concept:** $15,000 annual exclusion (2021) - indexed for inflation.

### 113. Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Exemption
**Question:** The generation-skipping transfer tax exemption is:
- A) $1 million
- B) $5 million
- C) $10 million
- D) $11.7 million

**Answer: D**
**Detailed Explanation:**
For 2021, the generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax exemption is $11.7 million per individual. This is the same amount as the estate tax exemption. The GST tax applies to transfers that skip a generation (e.g., grandparent to grandchild).

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) $1 million:** This was the amount before 2001.
- **B) $5 million:** This was the amount in 2011.
- **C) $10 million:** Close but not current; $11.7 million is correct for 2021.

**Key Concept:** GST exemption = estate tax exemption = $11.7M (2021).

---

### 114. Estate Tax Exclusion
**Question:** The estate tax exclusion is:
- A) $1 million
- B) $5 million
- C) $10 million
- D) $11.7 million

**Answer: D**
**Detailed Explanation:**
For 2021, the federal estate tax exemption is $11.7 million per individual. This means estates valued below this amount are not subject to federal estate tax. The exemption is portable between spouses, allowing a surviving spouse to use any unused portion of the deceased spouse's exemption.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) $1 million:** This was the amount before 2001.
- **B) $5 million:** This was the amount from 2011-2012.
- **C) $10 million:** Close but not current; increased to $11.7M with inflation indexing.

**Key Concept:** $11.7M estate tax exemption (2021) - indexed annually for inflation.

---

### 115. Step-Up in Basis Rules
**Question:** The step-up in basis applies to:
- A) Gifts
- B) Inherited property
- C) Both
- D) Neither

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
Inherited property receives a "step-up" in basis to its fair market value at the date of death (or alternate valuation date). This means the recipient's basis for capital gains purposes is the value at inheritance, not what the decedent paid. Gifts, conversely, generally carry over the donor's basis (carryover basis).

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) Gifts:** Gifts typically use carryover basis, not step-up.
- **C) Both:** Incorrect because gifts don't get step-up.
- **D) Neither:** Incorrect because inherited property does get step-up.

**Key Concept:** Step-up basis for inheritances; carryover basis for gifts.

---

### 116. Wash Sale Rule Time Period
**Question:** The wash sale rule applies within:
- A) 7 days
- B) 30 days
- C) 61 days
- D) 90 days

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
The wash sale rule (IRC Section 1091) disallows loss recognition if substantially identical securities are purchased within 30 days before or after the sale that generated the loss. This creates a 61-day window (30 days before, day of sale, 30 days after).

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) 7 days:** Too short; the rule covers 30 days.
- **C) 61 days:** This is the total window, but the question asks for the period before/after.
- **D) 90 days:** Too long; not the wash sale period.

**Key Concept:** Wash sale = 30 days before/after sale (61-day total window).

### 117. Net Investment Income Tax Rate
**Question:** The net investment income tax is:
- A) 1.45%
- B) 2.35%
- C) 3.8%
- D) 5.0%

**Answer: C**
**Detailed Explanation:**
The Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) is 3.8% and applies to the lesser of: (1) net investment income, or (2) modified adjusted gross income over threshold amounts ($200,000 single, $250,000 married filing jointly). It was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) 1.45%:** This is the Medicare tax rate for employees.
- **B) 2.35%:** This is the Additional Medicare Tax on earned income over $200,000.
- **D) 5.0%:** Not a current NIIT rate.

**Key Concept:** NIIT = 3.8% on investment income above thresholds.

---

### 118. Maximum Long-Term Capital Gains Rate
**Question:** The maximum long-term capital gains rate is:
- A) 15%
- B) 20%
- C) 23.8%
- D) 37%

**Answer: C**
**Detailed Explanation:**
The maximum federal long-term capital gains rate is 20% for those in the highest tax bracket. However, when combined with the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax, the total potential rate is 23.8%. This applies to taxpayers with income above certain thresholds.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) 15%:** This is the rate for middle-income taxpayers.
- **B) 20%:** This is the base maximum rate but doesn't include NIIT.
- **D) 37%:** This is the top ordinary income tax rate, not capital gains.

**Key Concept:** Max LTCG rate = 20% + 3.8% NIIT = 23.8% total.

---

### 119. Charitable Deduction Limit for Cash
**Question:** The charitable deduction limit for cash contributions is:
- A) 30% of AGI
- B) 50% of AGI
- C) 60% of AGI
- D) 100% of AGI

**Answer: C**
**Detailed Explanation:**
For 2021, cash contributions to public charities are deductible up to 100% of adjusted gross income (AGI) due to temporary COVID-19 relief provisions. However, under normal circumstances, the limit is 60% of AGI for cash contributions to public charities.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) 30% of AGI:** This applies to contributions of appreciated property to public charities.
- **B) 50% of AGI:** This was the previous limit for cash contributions before 2018.
- **D) 100% of AGI:** This is a temporary provision, not the standard rule.

**Key Concept:** Standard cash charitable deduction limit = 60% of AGI (100% temporarily).

---

### 120. Medical Expense Deduction Threshold
**Question:** The medical expense deduction threshold is:
- A) 5% of AGI
- B) 7.5% of AGI
- C) 10% of AGI
- D) 15% of AGI

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
For 2021, medical expenses are deductible to the extent they exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income (AGI). This threshold applies to all taxpayers, not just those 65 and older. It was made permanent at 7.5% by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) 5% of AGI:** This was never the threshold; it was 3% long ago.
- **C) 10% of AGI:** This was the threshold from 2013-2017 for those under 65.
- **D) 15% of AGI:** Too high; never been the threshold.

**Key Concept:** Medical expenses deductible above 7.5% of AGI (all taxpayers).

---

### 121. AMT Exemption for Married Filing Jointly
**Question:** The alternative minimum tax exemption for married filing jointly is approximately:
- A) $50,000
- B) $75,000
- C) $100,000
- D) $150,000

**Answer: C**
**Detailed Explanation:**
For 2021, the AMT exemption amounts are: $114,600 for married filing jointly, $73,600 for singles and heads of household, and $57,300 for married filing separately. These amounts phase out at higher income levels.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) $50,000:** Too low; this was the amount in the early 2000s.
- **B) $75,000:** Close but not exact; this is approximately the single amount.
- **D) $150,000:** Too high; the exemption is lower.

**Key Concept:** 2021 AMT exemption: $114,600 MFJ; phases out at higher incomes.

---

### 122. Maximum Deductible IRA Contribution (Age 50+)
**Question:** The maximum deductible IRA contribution for someone over 50 is:
- A) $6,000
- B) $7,000
- C) $25,000
- D) $58,000

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
For 2021, the IRA contribution limit is $6,000, with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution for those age 50 and older, for a total of $7,000. Deductibility depends on income, filing status, and workplace retirement plan coverage.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) $6,000:** This is the base limit without catch-up.
- **C) $25,000:** This is approximately the 401(k) limit with catch-up, not IRA.
- **D) $58,000:** This is the total defined contribution plan limit, not IRA.

**Key Concept:** IRA limit = $6,000 + $1,000 catch-up (50+) = $7,000 total.

---

### 123. Lifetime Learning Credit Maximum
**Question:** The lifetime learning credit maximum is:
- A) $1,000
- B) $2,000
- C) $2,500
- D) $3,000

**Answer: B**
**Detailed Explanation:**
The Lifetime Learning Credit provides a credit of up to $2,000 per tax return (20% of the first $10,000 of qualified expenses). Unlike the American Opportunity Credit, it has no limit on the number of years it can be claimed and covers a broader range of education.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) $1,000:** This was the Hope Credit amount before 2009.
- **C) $2,500:** This is the American Opportunity Credit maximum.
- **D) $3,000:** Not a current education credit amount.

**Key Concept:** Lifetime Learning Credit = 20% of first $10,000 expenses = $2,000 max.

---

### 124. Foreign Earned Income Exclusion
**Question:** The foreign earned income exclusion is approximately:
- A) $50,000
- B) $75,000
- C) $100,000
- D) $150,000

**Answer: C**
**Detailed Explanation:**
For 2021, the foreign earned income exclusion is $108,700. This allows qualifying U.S. citizens and residents living abroad to exclude foreign earned income from U.S. taxation. To qualify, taxpayers must meet either the bona fide residence test or physical presence test.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) $50,000:** Too low; this was the amount in the 1990s.
- **B) $75,000:** Too low; increased significantly over time.
- **D) $150,000:** Too high; the exclusion is lower.

**Key Concept:** 2021 foreign earned income exclusion = $108,700 (indexed annually).

---

### 125. Trust Tax Rate Bracket Threshold
**Question:** The trust tax rates reach the highest bracket at:
- A) $5,000
- B) $10,000
- C) $13,000
- D) $50,000

**Answer: C**
**Detailed Explanation:**
For 2021, trusts reach the highest tax bracket (37%) at $13,050 of taxable income. Trusts have compressed tax brackets, meaning they reach higher rates much faster than individuals. This creates tax planning considerations for income distribution.

**Why other options are wrong:**
- **A) $5,000:** Too low; the 37% bracket starts higher.
- **B) $10,000:** Close but not exact; $13,050 is correct.
- **D) $50,000:** Too high; trusts reach highest bracket much sooner.

**Key Concept:** Trusts reach 37% bracket at $13,050 (2021) - much lower than individuals.
