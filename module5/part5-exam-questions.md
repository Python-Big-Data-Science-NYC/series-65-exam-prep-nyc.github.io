**Correct Answer**: C) Violation - omission of material conflict

**Explanation**:

### **Question 2**

**Scenario**: An adviser works with a sophisticated, wealthy client. The adviser withholds risk information about an investment, thinking "This client is smart enough to understand the risks anyway."

## **Final Memory Rules**

### Repeat These Before the Exam:

1. **"Registration is disclosure, not approval."**
2. **"Exemption is paperwork relief, not fraud relief."**
3. **"Suitability is not best interest."**
4. **"Silence can be fraud."**
5. **"Conflict hidden equals fraud."**
6. **"Client first always."**
7. **"Material means important to investors."**
8. **"Disclose or lose your license."**

## **Decision Tree for Tough Questions**

When unsure on exam questions, ask:

1. **Is this in the client's best interest?**
2. **Would full disclosure change the decision?**
3. **Does this create a misleading impression?**
4. **Would a reasonable investor consider this important?**

If **YES** to any → Probably violates securities laws.
