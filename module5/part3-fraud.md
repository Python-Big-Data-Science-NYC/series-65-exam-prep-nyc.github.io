# 🚨 Part 3: Fraud & Anti-Fraud Rules

## **Fraud is Always Illegal**

### The Absolute Rule:
Fraud is **ALWAYS** illegal in securities transactions.

**NO exceptions.**
**NO loopholes.**
**NO exemptions.**
**NO registration status matters.**

Fraud is fraud. Always.

## **What Constitutes Fraud?**

### 1. Lying (Misrepresentation)
- False statements of fact
- Made knowingly or recklessly
- Investor relies on the falsehood
- Causes financial harm

### 2. Omitting Important Facts (Omission)
- Failure to disclose material information
- Creates false or misleading impression
- Silence when there is duty to speak
- Partial truth that implies falsehood

### 3. Misleading Statements
- Technically true but misleading
- Out-of-context information
- Cherry-picked data
- Ambiguous language designed to deceive

### 4. Fake Performance Claims
- Fabricated track records
- Altered performance data
- False testimonials
- Imaginary clients or results

### 5. Hidden Conflicts
- Undisclosed compensation arrangements
- Secret financial interests
- Unrevealed affiliations
- Hidden incentives

### 6. False Guarantees
- Promises of specific returns
- Assurances against loss
- Certainty claims
- "Risk-free" assertions

### 7. Manipulation
- Artificial price movements
- Wash trading
- Spoofing (fake orders)
- Pump-and-dump schemes

### 8. Deception
- Any action intended to mislead
- Creating false impressions
- Concealing true facts
- Distorting reality

## **The Critical Concept: Silence as Fraud**

### When Silence Becomes Fraud:
Silence can be fraud when:
1. **Material fact exists** (important information)
2. **Duty to disclose exists** (fiduciary, regulatory, or contractual)
3. **Silence creates false impression**
4. **Investor would act differently if informed**

### Example:
An adviser recommends a fund. The adviser receives 5% commission from this fund but only 1% from comparable funds. The adviser doesn't mention this.

**This is fraud by omission.**

## **Materiality Standard**

### The Test:
Information is **material** if:
> A reasonable investor would consider it important in making an investment decision.

### Factors Considered:
- Probability the event will occur
- Magnitude of impact if it occurs
- Timing and relevance
- Investor sophistication
- Market expectations

## **Scienter Requirement**

### Definition:
**Scienter** means intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.

### Levels of Scienter:
1. **Intentional** - Purposeful deception
2. **Reckless** - Conscious disregard for truth
3. **Negligent** - Failure to exercise reasonable care (in some cases)

### Important:
For many securities fraud violations, **recklessness is enough**. You don't need to prove specific intent to defraud.

## **Key Anti-Fraud Provisions**

### Rule 10b-5 (The Main Anti-Fraud Rule)
It is unlawful to:
1. Employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud
2. Make any untrue statement of material fact
3. Omit to state a material fact
4. Engage in any act that operates as a fraud

### Section 17(a) of Securities Act
Similar to Rule 10b-5 but applies to **offer and sale** of securities (not just trading).

### Insider Trading Rules
- **Rule 10b5-1**: Trading on material nonpublic information
- **Rule 10b5-2**: Duties of trust or confidence
- **Rule 14e-3**: Tender offer insider trading

## **Defenses That DON'T Work**

### Common Failed Defenses:
1. **"The client didn't ask"** - Duty to disclose exists regardless
2. **"The client is sophisticated"** - Disclosure still required
3. **"It was in the small print"** - Must be clear and conspicuous
4. **"Everyone does it"** - Not a legal defense
5. **"The client made money"** - Fraud is still fraud
6. **"No specific lies were told"** - Omissions can be fraud

## **Enforcement and Penalties**

### Who Enforces:
- **SEC** (Securities and Exchange Commission)
- **FINRA** (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority)
- **State regulators**
- **DOJ** (Department of Justice) for criminal cases

### Possible Penalties:
- **Civil fines** (money penalties)
- **Disgorgement** (return of ill-gotten gains)
- **Injunctions** (court orders to stop)
- **Industry bars** (cannot work in securities)
- **Criminal prosecution** (jail time)
- **Restitution** (pay back victims)

## **Memory Rules for the Exam**

### Rule 1:
> "If it matters, it must be said. Silence can be fraud."

### Rule 2:
> "Fraud has no friends - no exemptions, no excuses."

### Rule 3:
> "Half-truths are whole frauds."

### Rule 4:
> "Material means important to investors, not just to you."

### Rule 5:
> "Disclose conflicts or face consequences."

## **Real-World Application**

### Questions to Ask Yourself:
1. Would this information change the client's decision?
2. Am I creating a false impression?
3. Am I withholding important facts?
4. Would I want this disclosed if I were the investor?
5. Can this be misunderstood or misinterpreted?

### When in Doubt:
**DISCLOSE, DISCLOSE, DISCLOSE.**
