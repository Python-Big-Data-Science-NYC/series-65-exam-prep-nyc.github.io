# 📝 Part 2: Registration & Disclosure: Mechanics, Exemptions, and Continuous Obligations

## **I. The Registration Paradigm: A Disclosure Regime, Not a Merit Review**

### **A. The Legal Definition & Purpose of Registration**
Under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, it is unlawful to offer or sell a security through interstate commerce unless a **registration statement** is in effect with the SEC, or an exemption applies.

**Registration** is a **procedural mechanism** that triggers a mandatory disclosure cascade:
1.  **Filing of a Registration Statement (Form S-1, etc.):** Submitted to the SEC, containing exhaustive detail about the issuer.
2.  **Production & Delivery of a Prospectus:** The consumer-facing document derived from the registration statement, which must be delivered to all purchasers in a public offering.
3.  **SEC Review (Non-Merit):** The SEC staff reviews for **completeness and clarity of disclosure**, not the quality, price, or investment merit of the security.

### **B. The Critical Distinction: Transparency vs. Endorsement**
Registration is **NOT** a seal of approval. The SEC’s declaration that a registration statement is "effective" signifies only that the issuer may proceed with the sale, having satisfied disclosure requirements.

**Registration DOES mean:**
*   ✅ A standardized, audited information set is publicly available.
*   ✅ The issuer and its agents assume heightened liability for material misstatements (Sections 11 & 12).
*   ✅ The security enters the public, secondary market with ongoing reporting obligations (1934 Act).

**Registration does NOT mean:**
*   ❌ The SEC has vouched for the business model.
*   ❌ The investment is "safe" or likely to be profitable.
*   ❌ The offering price is fair.
*   ❌ The company will succeed.
*   ❌ The risks are minimal.

> **SERIES 65 PRACTICE QUESTION 2.1:** A client reads that an IPO has an "effective" registration statement with the SEC. She tells you this means the SEC has approved the stock as a good investment. Your most accurate response is:
> **A.** She is correct; the SEC's effectiveness order signifies the staff has determined the stock is fairly priced.
> **B.** She is incorrect; "effective" means the issuer has satisfied disclosure rules, but the SEC expressly does not evaluate the investment's merit or likelihood of success.
> **C.** She is partially correct; the SEC approves the business plan but not the stock price.
> **D.** The statement is only true for equity offerings, not for debt offerings.
> {% raw %}<details><summary>Answer & Rationale</summary><strong>B. She is incorrect; "effective" means the issuer has satisfied disclosure rules, but the SEC expressly does not evaluate the investment's merit or likelihood of success.</strong> This is the fundamental disclosure vs. merit distinction. The SEC reviews for compliance with disclosure regulations, not business viability (A, C). This principle applies to all securities requiring registration (D).

## **II. Exempt Securities: Exemption by Nature of the Issuer**

Certain securities are exempt from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act **based on the identity and perceived creditworthiness of the issuer**, as defined in Section 3(a). They are not subject to the Section 5 prohibition.

### **A. Statutory List of Exempt Securities**
*   **Securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, a state, or a political subdivision (Municipal Bonds):** Rooted in federalism and the credit of the public treasury.
*   **Securities issued by banks, savings institutions, or credit unions (if subject to regulatory oversight):** Heavily regulated by other banking authorities.
*   **Short-term commercial paper** with a maturity not exceeding **270 days (9 months)** and meeting "current transaction" requirements (e.g., top-tier credit quality, proceeds for current operations).
*   **Securities of non-profit, religious, educational, or charitable organizations.**
*   **Insurance policies and fixed annuity contracts** (regulated under state insurance law).
*   **Securities issued in certain corporate reorganizations** (exchanges with existing security holders).

### **B. Critical Nuance: Exemption ≠ Risk-Free**
The exemption is for **registration only**. These securities:
*   **ARE subject to the antifraud provisions** of the 1933 Act (Section 17) and the 1934 Act (Rule 10b-5).
*   **MAY have significant risks** (e.g., interest rate risk, credit risk of a municipality, default risk).
*   **ARE often regulated under other regimes** (e.g., banking law, insurance law).

**Warning**: A municipal bond is exempt from registration, but a broker-dealer selling it still has a duty of fair dealing and must disclose known material risks, such as a city's deteriorating finances.

> **SERIES 65 PRACTICE QUESTION 2.2:** All of the following securities are exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 EXCEPT:
> **A.** General obligation bonds issued by the state of California.
> **B.** A 10-year corporate bond issued by a national bank.
> **C.** 180-day commercial paper issued by a large, creditworthy industrial company to fund inventory.
> **D.** A new issue of common stock by a biotechnology startup selling to the public for the first time.
> {% raw %}<details><summary>Answer & Rationale</summary><strong>D. A new issue of common stock by a biotechnology startup selling to the public for the first time.</strong> This is a classic, non-exempt public offering requiring registration. Municipal bonds (A) and certain bank securities (B) are exempt securities. Short-term commercial paper under 270 days meeting the qualifications is exempt (C).
> </details>{% endraw %}

## **III. Exempt Transactions: Exemption by Manner of Sale**

These are exemptions under **Section 4 of the 1933 Act and its associated rules**. The security itself is not inherently exempt, but the **specific transaction** in which it is sold does not require registration. This is the realm of private placements and limited offerings.

### **A. The Private Placement Exemption: Section 4(a)(2) and Regulation D**
This is the most significant transactional exemption for raising capital.

#### **1. Rule 506(b) – The "Safe Harbor" for Private Placements**
*   **Unlimited Raising Cap:** No limit on the dollar amount that can be raised.
*   **Purchaser Requirements:** Can be sold to an **unlimited number of Accredited Investors** and up to **35 non-accredited, sophisticated purchasers**.
*   **Sophistication Requirement for Non-Accrediteds:** The issuer must reasonably believe that each non-accredited purchaser, either alone or with a purchaser representative, has sufficient knowledge and experience to evaluate the merits and risks of the investment.
*   **General Solicitation/Advertising Prohibited.**
*   **Disclosure Requirements:** Non-accredited purchasers must receive disclosure comparable to a registration statement (a Private Placement Memorandum - PPM). Accredited investors need not receive specific disclosures, but antifraud rules still mandate all material information be provided.

#### **2. Rule 506(c) – The "General Solicitation" Exemption**
*   Added by the JOBS Act. Allows **general solicitation and advertising**.
*   **Critical Condition:** All purchasers must be **Accredited Investors**, and the issuer must take **reasonable steps to verify** their accredited status (e.g., review tax forms, W-2s, confirmation from a broker-dealer or attorney).
*   No 35-person limit for non-accrediteds because none are allowed.

#### **3. Rule 504 – Small Offering Exemption**
*   **Cap:** Can raise up to **$10 million** in a 12-month period.
*   **Purchaser Limits:** None on the number or sophistication of investors.
*   **General Solicitation:** May be allowed depending on state law and other conditions.
*   **Resale Restrictions:** Securities are typically "restricted" and cannot be freely resold without registration or an exemption.

### **B. The Accredited Investor Definition (Rule 501)**
This is a cornerstone concept for private capital formation. Criteria include:
*   **Income:** >$200,000 individual (or $300,000 joint with spouse) in each of the last two years, with a reasonable expectation of the same.
*   **Net Worth:** >$1,000,000, **excluding the value of the primary residence**. (This post-Dodd-Frank adjustment is crucial).
*   **Entities:** Certain institutions, trusts, partnerships, 501(c)(3) organizations, and entities with >$5 million in assets.
*   **Knowledgeable Employees** of the issuer (for certain private funds).
*   **SEC-Certified "Sophistication":** Individuals holding certain professional credentials (Series 7, 65, 82) may qualify.

> **SERIES 65 PRACTICE QUESTION 2.3:** An issuer plans to raise $15 million by selling limited partnership interests. It wants to use general advertising to find investors. To qualify for an exemption under Rule 506(c), the issuer must:
> **A.** Sell only to no more than 35 non-accredited investors.
> **B.** Sell only to accredited investors and take reasonable steps to verify their accredited status.
> **C.** Provide all purchasers with a full prospectus identical to that used in a registered offering.
> **D.** Limit the offering to investors within a single state.
> {% raw %}<details><summary>Answer & Rationale</summary><strong>B. Sell only to accredited investors and take reasonable steps to verify their accredited status.</strong> Rule 506(c) explicitly allows general solicitation but imposes a strict condition: all purchasers must be accredited, and the issuer has an affirmative obligation to verify (not just accept a check-box). A describes Rule 506(b). C describes a registered offering. D describes an intrastate offering under Rule 147.
> </details>{% endraw %}

### **C. The Intrastate Offering Exemption: Rule 147/147A**
*   **Concept:** An offering confined to a single state, where the issuer is a resident and doing business within that state.
*   **Key Requirements:**
1.  **Issuer "Residence":** Must be organized in the state and have its "principal place of business" there.
2.  **Offerees & Purchasers:** Must all be residents of the same state.
3.  **Use of Proceeds:** At least 80% must be used within that state.
*   **Resale Restrictions:** Securities cannot be resold to out-of-state residents for **6 months**.
*   **Preemption:** These offerings are **NOT "covered securities"** under NSMIA and remain subject to state (Blue Sky) registration and merit review.

### **D. Regulation A ("Reg A+") – The Mini-IPO**
A two-tiered exemption for smaller public offerings, bridging the gap between private placements and full IPOs.

*   **Tier 1:** Offers up to **$20 million** in 12 months. Subject to **both federal and state registration/review**.
*   **Tier 2:** Offers up to **$75 million** in 12 months. **Preempted from state registration/review**. However, issuers must:
*   Provide audited financials.
*   File annual, semi-annual, and current reports (scaled disclosure).
*   Limit the amount non-accredited investors can invest to **10% of the greater of their annual income or net worth**.

**Key Idea:** Exemptions are based on a regulatory judgment that the **buyers' sophistication, the limited scope, or the smaller size of the offering** reduces the need for the full registration process, thereby facilitating capital formation while maintaining investor protection through other means (e.g., purchaser limits, disclosure to non-accrediteds, antifraud rules).

> **SERIES 65 PRACTICE QUESTION 2.4:** An investor with an annual income of $85,000 wants to invest $15,000 in a Tier 2 Regulation A offering. Which of the following is TRUE?
> **A.** The investment is prohibited because Tier 2 is only for accredited investors.
> **B.** The investment is allowed because Tier 2 has no investment limits.
> **C.** The investment may be allowed if it does not exceed 10% of the investor's annual income or net worth.
> **D.** The investment is allowed only if the investor is a resident of the same state as the issuer.
> {% raw %}<details><summary>Answer & Rationale</summary><strong>C. The investment may be allowed if it does not exceed 10% of the investor's annual income or net worth.</strong> Tier 2 of Reg A+ is unique in that it allows non-accredited investors to participate, but with a protective investment cap. The cap is the lesser of 10% of annual income or 10% of net worth. A is false (accredited status not required). B is false (caps exist for non-accrediteds). D describes an intrastate offering, not Reg A.

## **IV. Disclosure Documents: Form Follows Function**

### **A. The Prospectus (Registered Offerings)**
*   **The Statutory Document:** The written document that must precede or accompany the sale in a registered public offering (Section 5(b)(2)).
*   **Content:** Must contain the information found in the registration statement, presented in an accessible format. Includes "plain English" risk factors, use of proceeds, management discussion, and audited financials.
*   **Preliminary ("Red Herring"):** Used during the waiting period. Contains a legend stating it is not final and that offers cannot be accepted.
*   **Final Prospectus:** The definitive offering document delivered at or before settlement.

### **B. The Private Placement Memorandum (PPM)**
*   **The Equivalent for Exempt Offerings:** While not strictly required by the 1933 Act for sales to accredited investors, it is **universal market practice and a critical antifraud tool**.
*   **Purpose:** Serves as the primary vehicle for disclosing all material information to offerees, thereby defending against claims of omission or misrepresentation.
*   **Content:** Mirrors a prospectus: business description, risk factors, management bios, financial statements (often unaudited), terms of the offering, and conflicts of interest.

### **C. The Offering Circular (Regulation A)**
*   **A Hybrid Document:** The disclosure document for Reg A offerings. Less exhaustive than an S-1 prospectus but more formal than a typical PPM. Filed with the SEC on Form 1-A.

**Memory Aid:** `Prospectus` = Public. `PPM` = Private. `Offering Circular` = Middle Ground (Reg A).

> **SERIES 65 PRACTICE QUESTION 2.5:** For a private placement under Rule 506(b) sold to both accredited and non-accredited investors, which of the following is TRUE regarding disclosure documents?
> **A.** No formal disclosure document is required by law for any investor.
> **B.** A full prospectus, identical to that used in an IPO, must be delivered to all investors.
> **C.** Non-accredited investors must be furnished with disclosure documents containing information similar to that in a registration statement, while accredited investors have no specific disclosure entitlement under the rule (though antifraud rules apply).
> **D.** Only a brief term sheet is required.
> {% raw %}<details><summary>Answer & Rationale</summary><strong>C. Non-accredited investors must be furnished with disclosure documents containing information similar to that in a registration statement, while accredited investors have no specific disclosure entitlement under the rule (though antifraud rules apply).</strong> This is a precise test of Rule 506(b) requirements. The rule explicitly mandates specific, extensive disclosure to any non-accredited purchaser. For accredited investors, the rule is silent, but the overarching antifraud provisions of Rule 10b-5 create a legal duty not to mislead or omit material facts, which is typically fulfilled via a PPM.

## **V. Continuous Disclosure: The 1934 Act's Ongoing Obligation**

For companies that have registered securities under the 1933 Act or have a class of securities listed on an exchange or meeting certain shareholder thresholds, the **Securities Exchange Act of 1934** imposes a system of **periodic and episodic reporting**.

### **A. Key Reporting Forms**
*   **Form 10-K (Annual Report):** Comprehensive annual filing including audited financials, management discussion & analysis (MD&A), business description, and risk factors.
*   **Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report):** Unaudited quarterly financials and update on material developments.
*   **Form 8-K (Current Report):** Filed to report **material corporate events** within 4 business days. Examples: entry/termination of a material agreement, acquisition, bankruptcy, change in control, departure of CEO/CFO, results of shareholder votes.

### **B. The "Total Mix" Doctrine and Materiality**
Continuous disclosure ensures the **"total mix"** of information available to the public and the market is kept current. The materiality standard from *TSC Industries* applies here: would the information alter the total mix and be viewed by a reasonable investor as significantly altering that mix?

**Examples of Material Events for an 8-K:**
*   A significant merger agreement.
*   Discovery of a massive accounting fraud.
*   Receipt of a Wells Notice from the SEC.
*   A change in the company's independent auditor.

> **SERIES 65 PRACTICE QUESTION 2.6:** A publicly traded company's board approves a definitive agreement to be acquired by a larger competitor at a 40% premium to the current stock price. The company is required to publicly disclose this information:
> **A.** In its next quarterly 10-Q report.
> **B.** In its annual 10-K report.
> **C.** Within 4 business days via a Form 8-K.
> **D.** Only after the merger is officially completed.
> {% raw %}<details><summary>Answer & Rationale</summary><strong>C. Within 4 business days via a Form 8-K.</strong> A definitive merger agreement is a quintessential "material corporate event" requiring prompt disclosure on Form 8-K. Waiting for a periodic 10-Q or 10-K (A, B) would violate the timely disclosure principles of the 1934 Act. Disclosure is required upon the event (board approval/signing), not completion (D).
> </details>{% endraw %}

## **VI. The Unbreakable Rule: Antifraud Provisions Apply Universally**

**THE MOST TESTABLE CONCEPT IN THIS SECTION:** The exemption of a security or transaction from **registration** under the 1933 Act does **NOT** exempt it from the **antifraud provisions** of the federal securities laws.

### **A. Sources of Antifraud Liability in Exempt Offerings**
1.  **Section 17(a) of the 1933 Act:** Prohibits fraud in the **offer or sale** of any security.
2.  **Rule 10b-5 under the 1934 Act:** Prohibits fraud in connection with the **purchase or sale** of any security.
3.  **State Blue Sky Laws:** All have their own antifraud provisions.

### **B. Practical Implications for Investment Professionals**
*   When recommending a private placement (Reg D), you have a duty to conduct **reasonable due diligence** and not rely blindly on the issuer's PPM.
*   You must disclose all **material conflicts of interest** (e.g., higher compensation for selling this product).
*   You cannot make **unsubstantiated projections or guarantees** of return.
*   **Suitability obligations** remain paramount, even for accredited investors.

**Registration Exemption ≠ Fraud Exemption. Dishonesty is never exempt.**

> **SERIES 65 PRACTICE QUESTION 2.7 (COMPREHENSIVE):** An investment adviser representative recommends an investment in a Rule 506 private placement to an accredited client. The IAR knows the issuer's financial statements in the PPM are materially overstated but does not disclose this to the client. Which of the following is TRUE?
> **A.** Because the offering is exempt from registration, the antifraud rules do not apply.
> **B.** Only the issuer can be liable for fraud; the IAR has no duty to investigate.
> **C.** The IAR and his firm have likely violated Rule 10b-5, as antifraud rules apply to all securities transactions, registered or exempt.
> **D.** Liability only exists if the client loses money.
> {% raw %}<details><summary>Answer & Rationale</summary><strong>C. The IAR and his firm have likely violated Rule 10b-5, as antifraud rules apply to all securities transactions, registered or exempt.</strong> This is the cardinal rule. Antifraud provisions are universal. Knowing misrepresentation or omission of a material fact (overstated financials) in connection with a securities transaction is a textbook 10b-5 violation. A is the exact misconception the exam tests. B is false; representatives have a duty not to perpetuate known frauds. D is false; the violation occurs at the time of the fraudulent act, though damages are a separate element for a private lawsuit.
