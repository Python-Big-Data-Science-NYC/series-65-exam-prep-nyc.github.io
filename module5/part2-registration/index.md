# 📝 Part 2: Registration & Disclosure

## **Registration Means Disclosure**

### Definition:
**Registration** means:
- The investment is filed with regulators
- Disclosure documents are provided to investors
- All risks are explained clearly
- All costs are disclosed upfront
- Business model is fully described

### Critical Distinction:
Registration does **NOT** mean:
- ✅ Safe
- ✅ Good  
- ✅ Profitable
- ✅ Approved
- ✅ Recommended

Registration **ONLY** means: **Transparent**

## **Exempt Securities**

Some securities are exempt from registration **by nature**.

### Examples:
- **Government bonds** (U.S. Treasury securities)
- **Municipal bonds** (state and local government)
- **Government agency securities** (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac)
- **Bank securities** (certain types)
- **Short-term commercial paper** (under 270 days)

### Key Concept:
These are exempt because of **issuer trust level**, not because they are risk-free.

**Warning**: Exempt does not mean safe. Municipal bonds can default. Government securities have interest rate risk.

## **Exempt Transactions**

Some **transactions** are exempt because of:
- Who is buying
- How it is sold
- The amount involved
- The location

### Common Exemptions:

#### 1. Private Placements (Rule 506)
- Sales to **accredited investors**
- Limited number of non-accredited investors (35 maximum)
- No general advertising
- **No limit on money raised**

#### 2. Accredited Investors
Definition includes:
- Income over $200,000 individual ($300,000 joint) for last 2 years
- Net worth over $1 million (excluding primary residence)
- Certain institutions
- Insiders of the issuer

#### 3. Intrastate Offerings (Rule 147)
- All investors in one state
- Business operates in that state
- 80% of proceeds used in that state

#### 4. Small Offerings (Regulation A)
- Tier 1: Up to $20 million
- Tier 2: Up to $75 million
- Limited disclosure requirements
- Some state review required

### Key Idea:
> Sometimes the buyer is considered sophisticated enough to not need full government protection.

## **Disclosure Documents**

### Primary Documents:

#### 1. Prospectus (Public Offerings)
- Full disclosure document
- Required for registered offerings
- Must be given to all investors
- Contains risks, financials, management info

#### 2. Private Placement Memorandum (PPM)
- For private offerings
- Similar to prospectus
- Required for exempt offerings
- Discloses all material information

#### 3. Offering Circular (Regulation A)
- Simplified disclosure
- For small public offerings
- Less detailed than prospectus

## **Continuous Disclosure**

For public companies, disclosure continues after initial offering:

### Required Filings:
- **Annual reports** (Form 10-K)
- **Quarterly reports** (Form 10-Q)
- **Current reports** (Form 8-K) for material events
- **Proxy statements** for shareholder votes

## **Material Information**

### Definition:
Information is **material** if:
- A reasonable investor would consider it important
- It would affect investment decisions
- It changes the total mix of available information

### Examples of Material Information:
- Financial performance changes
- New products or discoveries
- Management changes
- Legal proceedings
- Acquisition or merger discussions
- Regulatory investigations

## **Anti-Fraud Provisions Apply Always**

**Critical Rule**: Even if a security or transaction is exempt from registration...

**Anti-fraud rules STILL APPLY.**

### This Means:
- No lying
- No hiding material facts
- No misleading statements
- No fraudulent schemes
- No manipulation

**Registration exemption ≠ Fraud exemption**

## **Memory Aids**

### Rule 1:
> "Registration is paperwork, not approval."

### Rule 2:
> "Exempt means no filing, not no rules."

### Rule 3:
> "Disclose or lose - it's that simple."

### Rule 4:
> "If it matters to investors, it must be disclosed."
