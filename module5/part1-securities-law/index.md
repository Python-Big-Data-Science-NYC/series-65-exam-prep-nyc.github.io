# 📜 Part 1: Introduction to Securities Law

## **Why Securities Law Exists**

Securities law exists to do three fundamental things:

### 1. Protect Investors
- Prevent financial harm
- Ensure fair treatment
- Provide legal recourse
- Create trust in markets

### 2. Create Fair Markets
- Level playing field
- Transparent pricing
- Equal information access
- Orderly trading

### 3. Prevent Fraud
- Stop deception
- Eliminate manipulation
- Punish dishonesty
- Deter misconduct

## **The Golden Rule**

Everything in securities law comes back to one simple rule:

**No lying. No hiding. No misleading. No cheating.**

### Key Principle:
> If a client would make a different decision if they knew the truth, then the truth must be disclosed.

## **The Two Core Federal Laws**

### Securities Act of 1933
This law controls **new investments** being sold for the first time.

#### This Law is About **DISCLOSURE**:
- Not quality
- Not safety  
- Not performance
- Not approval

**Only disclosure.**

#### What This Means:
If you sell a new investment, you must:
- Tell all important facts
- Explain all risks
- Disclose all costs
- Reveal all conflicts
- Explain how money will be used

**Key Idea**: The government does not judge the investment. It only forces honesty.

**Memory Rule**: Truth over persuasion.

### Securities Exchange Act of 1934
This law controls **markets and trading** after securities are issued.

#### This Law Regulates:
- Stock exchanges
- Broker-dealers
- Trading activity
- Market behavior
- Fraud and manipulation

#### This Law Created:
- The main securities regulator
- Market integrity standards
- Fair trading rules
- Honest pricing requirements
- Transparency obligations

## **What Is a Security?**

A security is **any investment** where:

1. **A person gives money**
2. **They expect profit**
3. **The profit mainly comes from someone else's work**

This is called the **investment contract rule**.

### Simple Test:
> If the effort comes from others, it is usually a security.

### Common Examples:
- Stocks
- Bonds
- Mutual funds
- Investment contracts
- Limited partnerships
- Notes (with certain characteristics)
- Options
- Many private investments

### Not Usually Securities:
- Real estate (unless through REITs)
- Commodities (unless through futures)
- Collectibles
- Business ownership (active management)

## **Federal vs. State Regulation**

### Federal Regulation:
- National standards
- Interstate commerce
- Large markets
- Public companies

### State Regulation (Blue Sky Laws):
- Local investor protection
- State-specific rules
- Smaller offerings
- Local enforcement

### Important:
**State laws still apply even when federal laws exist.**

## **Core Principles Summary**

1. **Disclosure is mandatory** - not optional
2. **Fraud is always illegal** - no exceptions
3. **Registration means transparency** - not approval
4. **Investor protection comes first** - always
5. **Transparency beats marketing** - every time
